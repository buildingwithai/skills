# Skill Library

A curated library of Claude Skills with extensive research and resources. Currently focused on Product Marketing Management (PMM), expandable to other domains.

## What This Repository Is

This repository is a **public library of downloadable Claude Skills**:

1. **Skill Library** (`pmm-skills/`) - Download and import individual skills into Claude
2. **Research Workspace** (`resources/`) - Behind-the-scenes research that informs skill creation
3. **Self-Sustaining** - Documentation for AI to maintain and update skills over time

## What Are Claude Skills?

**Claude Skills** are folders containing instructions, reference materials, and templates that Claude can load when needed. Think of them as specialized "expert modes" that give Claude deep knowledge in specific domains.

### How to Use a Skill

1. **Download** - Grab the skill folder from `pmm-skills/[skill-name]/`
2. **Zip it** - Compress the folder into a .zip file
3. **Upload to Claude** - Go to Claude.ai Settings → Upload skill
4. **Use it** - Claude automatically loads the skill when relevant to your conversation

### Key Characteristics

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Claude only loads what it needs, when it needs it
- **Self-Contained**: Each skill includes everything needed (guides, templates, examples)
- **Reusable**: Use the same skill across different projects and conversations
- **Portable**: Skills work in Claude.ai, Claude Code, and via API

## How Claude Skills Work (Architecture)

Understanding how skills work helps you use them effectively and create new ones.

### Progressive Disclosure

Claude doesn't load the entire skill at once. Instead:

1. **First**: Claude reads `SKILL.md` (the navigation hub)
2. **Then**: Based on your request, Claude loads only relevant reference files
3. **Result**: Efficient context usage, no information overload

**Example:**

```
You: "Help me create positioning for my B2B product"

Claude's process:
1. Reads SKILL.md → sees decision tree
2. Decision tree says: "Creating positioning → load core/01-positioning-foundation.md"
3. Loads only that file
4. Works with you using that focused content

You never see the competitive positioning, crisis messaging, or other
advanced topics unless you specifically need them.
```

### Core vs Advanced Structure

Skills are organized into two levels:

#### **`references/core/`** - Sequential Workflow

- Main process most users go through
- **Numbered files** for sequence (01-, 02-, 03-...)
- Loaded in order for the primary use case
- Example: `01-positioning → 02-messaging → 03-rollout`

**When Claude loads core:**
- User asks to create/build/develop something
- Following the primary workflow
- Needs step-by-step process

#### **`references/advanced/`** - Situational Power-Ups

- Specific scenarios or edge cases
- **Named files** (not numbered) - load as needed
- Only relevant for specialized situations
- Example: `crisis-messaging.md`, `category-creation.md`

**When Claude loads advanced:**
- User mentions a specific scenario ("dealing with a crisis")
- Asks for deep dive on a specialized topic
- Needs techniques beyond the core process

    └── case-study.md           # Real company examples with metrics
```

### Decision Trees in SKILL.md

SKILL.md acts as a "navigation hub" that tells Claude what to load:

```markdown
## Quick Decision Trees

**Creating [thing] from scratch:**
→ Read: core/01-framework → core/02-process → core/03-execution
→ Use: template.md, checklist.md

**Handling [specific scenario]:**
→ Read: advanced/specific-scenario.md
→ Use: scenario-template.md

**[Specific challenge]:**
→ Read: advanced/deep-dive.md
→ Also see: core/02-process.md (section on X)
```

This allows Claude to:
- Quickly find relevant content
- Load only what's needed
- Provide accurate, focused guidance

### Why This Structure Works

1. **Efficiency**: Load 5-10KB instead of 100KB of content
2. **Focus**: User gets relevant info, not everything
3. **Scalability**: Can add advanced topics without bloating core
4. **Flexibility**: Same skill works for beginners and experts
