## When to Call: `positioning` Skill

### Use When:
- ✅ User doesn't know their ICP/target audience
- ✅ Need to define competitive alternatives (for "X vs Y" content)
- ✅ Clarifying unique value (for differentiation-based content)
- ✅ First time working with this product/idea

### What You'll Get:
- **ICP Analysis** - Who to target, their behaviors
- **Competitive Alternatives** - What you're replacing (contentable moment!)
- **Unique Value** - What's different (the "wow" factor)
- **Best-fit Customer** - Who has biggest transformation

### What to Extract for Content:
From ICP:
- Who shares content in this category?
- What platforms do they use?
- What's taboo vs acceptable?

From Positioning:
- Competitive alternative = "Before" in before/after content
- Unique value = The provocative angle
- Best-fit customer = Character for skits

### What to Skip:
- ❌ Internal rollout sections
- ❌ Sales enablement parts
- ❌ Positioning statement templates (we'll make provocative versions)

## When to Call: `messaging` Skill

### Use When:
- ✅ Need hook structure (pain-claim-gain = hook-setup-payoff)
- ✅ Creating multi-audience content
- ✅ Building message architecture for content series
- ✅ Don't have core messages defined

### What You'll Get:
- **Pain-Claim-Gain Framework** - Per audience
- **Message Hierarchy** - What to emphasize
- **Multi-Audience Messaging** - Different hooks for different personas

### What to Extract for Content:
Pain = Hook (0-3 seconds):
- Emotional pain → Visual representation
- Problem statement → Text overlay
- Frustration → Verbal hook

Claim = Setup (4-15 seconds):
- What you offer → Demo/explanation
- How it works → Show the product

Gain = Payoff (16-30 seconds):
- Outcome → Transformation shown
- Result → Stats, testimonials

### What to Skip:
- ❌ Internal comms sections
- ❌ Sales deck messaging
- ❌ Long-form content (we're optimizing for 15-30 sec)

## Common Integration Mistakes

**❌ Skipping positioning/messaging**
- "I'll just start making content"
- Result: Off-brand content that doesn't convert

**❌ Using entire other skills**
- Don't need sales enablement from messaging skill
- Extract only what's relevant for content

**❌ Over-prioritizing**
- If you have 3 ideas, just test them
- Don't spend 2 hours on prioritization framework

**❌ Not calling music-video skill for music content**
- Missing cinematography expertise
- This skill = strategy, that skill = execution
