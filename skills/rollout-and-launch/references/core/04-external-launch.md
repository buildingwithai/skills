# External Launch Strategy

Launch your new positioning and messaging to market with a phased, measured approach that minimizes risk and maximizes impact.

## Overview

You've tested your messaging, aligned your organization, and trained your teams. Now it's time to take the new messaging to market. But how you launch matters as much as what you launch.

**Why launch strategy matters:**
- Big-bang launches leave no room for iteration
- Phased approaches allow you to learn and adjust
- Channel sequencing affects perception and momentum
- Poor coordination creates confusion and inconsistency
- Strategic launches create market moments, not just updates

**What this guide covers:**
- The phased launch framework
- Channel prioritization and sequencing
- Timeline and coordination checklist
- Launch success metrics
- When to pivot vs persevere

## The Phased Launch Framework

Successful launches follow a progression from controlled channels (where you can iterate) to broad channels (where changes are expensive).

### Phase 1: Owned Channels (Week 1-2)

**Channels to update:**
- Website (homepage, product pages, about)
- Blog
- Email signatures
- Internal documentation
- Sales decks (already done in internal rollout)

**Why start here:**
- Full control over content
- Easy to iterate and fix
- Low cost to change
- Tests messaging in real-world context
- Gets teams comfortable with new language

**Metrics to track:**
- Website engagement (time on page, bounce rate)
- Form conversion rates
- Blog post engagement
- Search rankings (track changes)
- Internal feedback from teams

**Red flags:**
- Confusion in support tickets ("what do you do?")
- Drop in website conversion
- Negative team feedback
- SEO ranking drops for key terms

**Actions:**
- Monitor daily for first week
- Quick iterations based on feedback
- A/B test headline variations
- Track before/after metrics

### Phase 2: Direct Outreach (Week 2-3)

**Channels to activate:**
- Sales outbound emails (new sequences)
- SDR/BDR cold outreach
- Account-based marketing campaigns
- Customer Success check-ins
- Partner communications

**Why second:**
- One-to-one or one-to-few (easy to course-correct)
- Real-time feedback from prospects
- Tests messaging in actual sales conversations
- Can iterate before scaling

**Metrics to track:**
- Email open rates (did subject line work?)
- Reply rates (is messaging compelling?)
- Meeting booking rates
- Prospect questions ("what's changed?")
- Win rates (early indicator)

**What success looks like:**
- Similar or better open rates vs old messaging
- Increased reply rates (curiosity, interest)
- Shorter time-to-meeting
- Clearer, more focused conversations
- Fewer "what do you do?" questions

**If it's not working:**
- Gather specific feedback from sales
- Listen to recorded calls
- Identify patterns in objections
- Iterate messaging (especially subject lines, hooks)
- Don't scale until metrics improve

### Phase 3: Paid Media (Week 3-4)

**Channels to launch:**
- Google Ads (search, display)
- LinkedIn Ads
- Facebook/Instagram (if relevant)
- Retargeting campaigns
- Sponsored content

**Why third:**
- Costs money to run and change
- Broader audience means less control
- Need data from Phases 1-2 to optimize
- Tests messaging at scale

**Preparation:**
- Create 3-5 ad variations per channel
- Use messaging pillars as themes
- Test different hooks and CTAs
- Set budget for testing phase (2 weeks minimum)

**Metrics to track:**
- Click-through rate (CTR)
- Cost per click (CPC)
- Conversion rate (form fills, trials, demos)
- Cost per acquisition (CPA)
- Audience engagement (comments, shares)

**Testing approach:**
- Run A/B tests on headlines
- Test feature-focused vs outcome-focused
- Test different audience segments
- Iterate weekly based on performance

**Benchmarks (B2B SaaS):**
- LinkedIn CTR: 0.4-0.6% (good), 0.8%+ (great)
- Google Search CTR: 3-5% (good), 6%+ (great)
- Landing page conversion: 2-5% (good), 8%+ (great)

### Phase 4: Earned Media & PR (Week 4-6)

**Activities:**
- Press releases (if major positioning change)
- Analyst briefings (Gartner, Forrester)
- Industry publications (contributed articles)
- Podcast appearances
- Conference talks (if timing aligns)
- Social media thought leadership

**Why last:**
- Hardest to change once published
- Broadest reach = highest stakes
- Requires confident, validated messaging
- Builds on momentum from earlier phases

**Preparation:**
- Media kit with new messaging
- Press release template
- Analyst briefing deck
- Contributed article drafts
- Executive talking points

**Metrics to track:**
- Media mentions and sentiment
- Analyst perception (positive, neutral, negative)
- Inbound interest (demo requests, inquiries)
- Brand search volume
- Social media engagement

**Timeline:**
- Week 4: Brief key analysts and press
- Week 5: Publish contributed content
- Week 6: Press release (if doing one)
- Ongoing: Thought leadership and speaking

## Channel Prioritization Matrix

Not all channels are equal. Prioritize based on:

**Criteria for prioritization:**

| Channel | Control | Speed to Market | Cost to Change | Audience Size | Priority |
|---------|---------|----------------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| Website | High | Fast (1 day) | Low | Medium | 1 |
| Email signatures | High | Fast (1 day) | Low | Low | 1 |
| Sales decks | High | Fast (1 day) | Low | Low | 1 |
| Blog | High | Fast (2-3 days) | Low | Medium | 1 |
| Sales outreach | High | Fast (1 week) | Low | Medium | 2 |
| ABM campaigns | High | Medium (1 week) | Medium | Small | 2 |
| LinkedIn Ads | Medium | Medium (1 week) | Medium | Large | 3 |
| Google Ads | Medium | Medium (1 week) | Medium | Large | 3 |
| Press releases | Low | Slow (2-3 weeks) | High | Large | 4 |
| Analyst relations | Low | Slow (4-6 weeks) | High | Medium | 4 |

**Decision framework:**

**Launch immediately (Priority 1):**
- Full control
- Easy to iterate
- Must-haves for consistency

**Launch after 1-2 weeks (Priority 2):**
- Still controllable
- Real-world testing
- Can iterate before scaling

**Launch after 2-4 weeks (Priority 3):**
- Costs money
- Harder to change
- Need validation first

**Launch after 4-6 weeks (Priority 4):**
- Hardest to change
- Broadest reach
- Requires confidence in messaging

## When to Pivot vs Persevere

### Signals to Pivot (Change Messaging)

**Strong signals:**
- Clarity scores <3.5/5 in testing
- Consistent confusion in sales calls ("what do you do?")
- Conversion rates drop >20%
- Win rates decline significantly
- Team won't use messaging (despite training)

**What to do:**
- Pause external expansion
- Go back to testing
- Identify specific failure points
- Iterate messaging
- Re-test before re-launching

### Signals to Persevere (Give It Time)

**Consider these:**
- Metrics are flat (not declining)
- Conversion rates dip 5-10% (normal variation)
- Sales uncomfortable but improving
- Early positive feedback mixed with adjustment period
- Only 2-3 weeks into launch

**What to do:**
- Give it 60-90 days for lagging metrics
- Provide additional training/support
- Make minor iterations (hooks, CTAs)
- Don't change core positioning
- Monitor weekly, not daily

### Signals to Optimize (Tweak, Don't Overhaul)

**Look for:**
- Good clarity, but weak differentiation
- Strong engagement, low conversion
- Some channels working, others not
- Some personas responding, others not

**What to do:**
- A/B test variations
- Adjust emphasis (not positioning)
- Optimize channel-specific copy
- Refine persona adaptations
- Keep core messaging intact
