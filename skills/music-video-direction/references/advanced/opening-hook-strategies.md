# Opening Hook Strategies

## The Critical First 5-10 Seconds

**Reality:** Most viewers decide whether to keep watching within the first 5-10 seconds.

**Your task:** Make those seconds impossible to ignore.

## Why the Opening Matters

- Viewer attention is lowest at the start (they're deciding whether to invest time)
- First impression sets tone for entire video
- Algorithm favorability (watch time starts here)
- Shareability (people share videos with great openings)
- You never get a second chance at a first impression

## The Hook Psychology

**What makes humans unable to look away:**

1. **Pattern Interruption** - Something unexpected
2. **Mystery/Questions** - Unanswered question creates tension
3. **Shock/Surprise** - Jolts attention
4. **Beauty** - Aesthetic magnetism
5. **Relatability** - "That's me!"
6. **Motion** - Movement catches eye
7. **Contrast** - Stands out from surroundings

## 10 Proven Opening Hook Strategies

### 1. The Impossible Image

**Strategy:** Start with something that shouldn't exist

**Example:**
- Person floating in void
- Furniture in impossible location (stool in ocean)
- Physics-defying scenario presented as normal

**Why it works:** Cognitive dissonance - brain needs to resolve the impossibility

**Sora advantage:** Perfect for this - AI excels at impossible imagery

**Example opening:**
```
Clip 1 (0:00-0:10): Wide shot revealing person sitting on wooden stool in middle of endless ocean, microphone in hand, cord going into water. Present as matter-of-fact, no explanation.
```

**Pattern:** IMPOSSIBLE → Calmly Presented = Can't Look Away

### 2. The Slow Reveal

**Strategy:** Start close/dark/obscured, slowly reveal the striking whole

**Example:**
- Extreme close-up, pull back to reveal shocking context
- Start in darkness, light slowly reveals
- Tight frame, camera pulls back to show scale

**Why it works:** Mystery creates tension, payoff releases it satisfyingly

**Example opening:**
```
Clip 1 (0:00-0:10): Extreme close-up of eye. At 0:00: just iris visible. At 0:03: slow pull back begins. At 0:06: full face revealed covered in gold paint. At 0:09: continuing pull back reveals figure in gold is statue-still in white room.
```

**Pattern:** MYSTERY → Gradual Reveal → PAYOFF

### 3. The Action Drop-In

**Strategy:** Start in the middle of intense action

**Example:**
- Car chase already in progress
- Dance already at peak
- Falling through air
- Running from something

**Why it works:** Immediate energy, viewer catches up, no slow build needed

**Example opening:**
```
Clip 1 (0:00-0:10): POV shot of freefalling through sky, ground approaching, wind rushing. No context, no explanation. Pure adrenaline start.
```

**Pattern:** HIGH ENERGY → Figure Out Context Later

### 4. The Jarring Contrast

**Strategy:** Two opposite elements in unexpected combination

**Example:**
- Pristine white room with single chaotic element
- Peaceful scene with underlying tension
- Beautiful setting with disturbing detail

**Why it works:** Contrast demands attention, "something's wrong here"

**Example opening:**
```
Clip 1 (0:00-0:10): Perfectly symmetrical pastel pink children's bedroom. Everything pristine and cheerful. At 0:06: slow push in reveals everything covered in thin layer of dust, untouched. Unsettling perfection.
```

**Pattern:** EXPECTED A → But Actually B = Intrigue

### 5. The Single Striking Image

**Strategy:** One unforgettable visual, hold it, let it sink in

**Example:**
- Person in stunning environment, perfectly composed
- Surreal tableau
- Artistic perfection
- Minimalist beauty

**Why it works:** Pure aesthetic magnetism, photographically perfect

**Example opening:**
```
Clip 1 (0:00-0:10): Static shot. Person in flowing red dress standing alone in vast white salt flats, mirror reflection below. Perfectly centered, symmetrical, stunning. Minimal movement, maximum beauty.
```

**Pattern:** BEAUTIFUL → Hold → Let Viewer Absorb

### 6. The Question Generator

**Strategy:** Create immediate unanswered questions

**Example:**
- "Why are they there?"
- "What happened?"
- "What's about to happen?"

**Why it works:** Open loops in brain demand closure, must keep watching

**Example opening:**
```
Clip 1 (0:00-0:10): Close-up of person's hands trembling, holding old photograph. Can't see their face. Can't see photo clearly. Who are they? What's in the photo? Why are they shaking?
```

**Pattern:** MYSTERY → No Answers Yet → Must Keep Watching

### 7. The Visceral Sound

**Strategy:** Start with striking audio that demands attention

**Example:**
- Loud unexpected sound
- Eerie silence broken by sound
- Beautiful voice a cappella
- Jarring sound effect

**Why it works:** Ears alert brain, brain alerts eyes

**Note:** Can describe in Sora prompts but may need to add in editing

**Example opening:**
```
Clip 1 (0:00-0:10): Black screen. At 0:02: sharp glass shatter sound. At 0:03: image fades in on shattered mirror, person's fragmented reflection. Sound led, visual followed.
```

**Pattern:** AUDIO HOOK → Visual Payoff

### 8. The Text/Lyric Teaser

**Strategy:** Show key lyric or text before visuals

**Example:**
- Title card with provocative text
- Key lyric displayed
- Question posed in text

**Why it works:** Sets up what's coming, creates anticipation

**Note:** Sora may struggle with clean text - may need overlay in editing

**Example opening:**
```
Clip 1 (0:00-0:05): White text on black: "What if you were the only one who could see it?"
Clip 2 (0:05-0:15): Cut to person in crowded space, staring at something invisible to others.
```

**Pattern:** PROVOCATION → Visual Answer

### 9. The Immediate Emotion

**Strategy:** Start with raw, powerful emotion

**Example:**
- Person crying
- Laughing uncontrollably
- Screaming
- Pure joy or devastation

**Why it works:** Humans mirror emotion, instant empathy connection

**Example opening:**
```
Clip 1 (0:00-0:10): Extreme close-up of person's face, tears streaming, but laughing. Conflicting emotions. What's happening? Why both joy and sadness?
```

**Pattern:** RAW EMOTION → Empathy → Investment

### 10. The Meta Opening

**Strategy:** Acknowledge this is a music video, break fourth wall immediately

**Example:**
- Artist directly addressing camera
- Behind-the-scenes revealed then enters video
- "Let me tell you a story..."

**Why it works:** Honesty, directness, connection

**Example opening:**
```
Clip 1 (0:00-0:10): Artist sitting casually in empty studio, looks directly at camera with slight smile. "You ready?" Expression before performance begins.
```

**Pattern:** DIRECT CONNECTION → Performance Begins

## Combining Strategies

**Most powerful openings use 2-3 strategies:**

**Example Combination:**
- Impossible Image (1) + Slow Reveal (2)
- Start tight on impossible detail, pull back to reveal full impossible scenario

**Example Combination:**
- Striking Image (5) + Question Generator (6)
- Beautiful but mysterious image that raises questions

**Example Combination:**
- Action Drop-In (3) + Immediate Emotion (9)
- Start mid-action with character in emotional state

## Opening Types by Genre

### Pop
**Best hooks:** Action Drop-In, Striking Image, Immediate Energy
**Avoid:** Too slow/artistic (lose young audience)

### Hip-Hop
**Best hooks:** Power Image (low angle, confident), Impossible Image (flex), Question Generator
**Avoid:** Weak opening (undermines power)

### Indie/Alternative
**Best hooks:** Artistic Single Image, Mystery/Questions, Meta Opening
**Avoid:** Too generic or mainstream

### R&B
**Best hooks:** Emotional Immediately, Beautiful Striking Image, Slow Reveal (sensual)
**Avoid:** Too fast/chaotic

### Rock
**Best hooks:** Action Drop-In, Raw Emotion, Performance Energy
**Avoid:** Too polished/pretty

### Electronic/EDM
**Best hooks:** Impossible Image, Visual Effects, Fast Action
**Avoid:** Stillness (unless intentional contrast)

## Sora-Specific Opening Strategies

**Leverage Sora's strengths:**

✅ **Impossible scenarios** - Start with physics-defying imagery
✅ **Perfect symmetry** - AI can create perfectly composed openings
✅ **Surreal environments** - Spaces that couldn't exist
✅ **Scale violations** - Giant or tiny subjects in normal worlds
✅ **Atmospheric perfection** - Cinematic lighting and mood from frame one

⚠️ **Avoid for opening:**
❌ Complex human faces close-up (uncanny valley risk)
❌ Text/titles (may need to add in post)
❌ Rapid action (AI better at deliberate movements)

**Ideal Sora opening formula:**
```
STRIKING ENVIRONMENT + SIMPLE POWERFUL COMPOSITION + IMMEDIATE VISUAL INTEREST
```

## Testing Your Opening

**The 5-Second Test:**

Show someone just the first 5 seconds (no sound).

Ask:
1. Would you keep watching? Why?
2. What questions does it raise?
3. How does it make you feel?
4. What do you expect happens next?

If answers are "meh" or confused (not intrigued-confused), revise.

## Common Opening Mistakes

❌ **Slow fade-in from black** - Wastes precious seconds
✅ **Start with image immediately**

❌ **Logo/text card first** - Delays actual content
✅ **Visual hook first, credits later**

❌ **Generic establishing shot** - "Oh, another city/forest/room"
✅ **Distinctive establishing shot** - "What is THAT?"

❌ **Waiting for music to build** - Lose viewers before song even starts
✅ **Visual interest before audio hook**

❌ **Unclear/confusing** (bad confused)
✅ **Intriguing/mysterious** (good confused)

❌ **Trying to be clever but actually boring**
✅ **Simple but striking**

## Opening Length

**Ideal:** 5-10 seconds to establish hook

**Too short:** Under 3 seconds - doesn't land
**Too long:** Over 15 seconds - viewer lost

**Exception:** If the opening IS the hook (extended reveal), can go longer but MUST maintain tension

## The Opening Promise

Your opening makes a promise about what kind of video this is:

**Surreal opening** → Promises conceptual/artistic video
**Action opening** → Promises energy and movement
**Emotional opening** → Promises emotional journey
**Beautiful opening** → Promises aesthetic experience
**Performance opening** → Promises showcase of artist

**Make sure the rest of the video delivers on that promise.**

## After the Hook: The Transition

Once you've hooked them (0:00-0:10), the next 10-20 seconds must:

1. **Develop the hook** - Don't abandon what hooked them
2. **Introduce rhythm** - Get into the song's flow
3. **Establish the concept** - Make the approach clear
4. **Maintain interest** - Don't let energy drop yet

**Pattern:**
- 0:00-0:10: HOOK (grab attention)
- 0:10-0:20: DEVELOP (keep attention)
- 0:20-0:30: ESTABLISH (now they're invested, show the world)

## Examples of Great Opening Hooks

**Childish Gambino - "This Is America"**
- Opens with disarming happy performance
- Sets up for shocking contrast moments later
- Question: What kind of video is this? (Answered shockingly)

**OK Go - "Here It Goes Again"**
- Immediate unusual visual (treadmills)
- Question: What are they going to do?
- Promise: This will be impressive (delivered)

**Björk - "All Is Full of Love"**
- Beautiful striking image immediately (robot assembly)
- Question: What is this world?
- Promise: Visual beauty and surrealism

**FKA twigs - "Cellophane"**
- Opens at the end (falling)
- Question: How did we get here?
- Promise: Emotional and visual journey

## Your Opening Checklist

- [ ] Does it grab attention in first 5 seconds?
- [ ] Is it visually striking or conceptually intriguing (or both)?
- [ ] Does it raise a question or create mystery?
- [ ] Does it promise what the video will deliver?
- [ ] Is it appropriate for the genre?
- [ ] Would I personally keep watching after 10 seconds?
- [ ] Does it leverage Sora's strengths (if using AI)?
- [ ] Is it simple enough to execute well?

## Final Thought

**The opening doesn't have to be the BEST moment** - it has to be the most ATTENTION-GRABBING moment.

Save your best for the chorus. The opening's job is to make sure people see your best.

**Opening = Hook**
**Chorus = Payoff**
