# Visual Effects Library

## Catalog of Effects for Sora Prompts

Quick reference for describing visual effects in Sora prompts.

## Atmospheric Effects

**FOG/MIST:**
```
Thick volumetric fog at ground level, creating mysterious atmosphere
Soft diffused mist throughout, reducing visibility to 20 feet
```

**LIGHT RAYS:**
```
Volumetric light rays streaming through windows, visible dust particles
God rays breaking through clouds, creating dramatic shafts of light
```

**PARTICLES:**
```
Dust particles floating in air, visible in light beams
Snow falling gently, accumulating on surfaces
Floating embers rising from below, orange glow
```

## Transformation Effects

**DISSOLVING:**
```
Subject slowly dissolving into particles from bottom up
Figure fading to transparency, becoming ghostlike
```

**MORPHING:**
```
Object gradually transforming into different object
Person's features slowly shifting, subtle metamorphosis
```

**GROWTH:**
```
Flowers sprouting and blooming in time-lapse speed
Vines growing and spreading across walls rapidly
```

## Motion Effects

**SLOW MOTION:**
```
Subject moving at 50% speed while environment moves normally
Water droplets suspended mid-air, ultra slow motion
```

**TIME-LAPSE:**
```
Clouds racing across sky in fast motion
Day to night transition in 5 seconds
```

**REVERSE MOTION:**
```
Water flowing upward instead of down
Shattered glass pieces flying back together
```

## Lighting Effects

**GLOW:**
```
Subject emanating soft warm glow from within
Neon-like edge lighting around figure
```

**FLARE:**
```
Horizontal anamorphic lens flare across frame
Sun creating natural lens flare, not excessive
```

**SHADOWS:**
```
Long dramatic shadows extending across scene
Multiple overlapping shadows from different light sources
```

## Surreal Effects

**GRAVITY DEFYING:**
```
Objects floating in mid-air, suspended weightlessly
Person walking on ceiling as if it's the floor
```

**SCALE VIOLATION:**
```
Normal person in room where furniture is 3x too large
Tiny figure in otherwise normal environment
```

**IMPOSSIBLE PHYSICS:**
```
Water flowing in circular loop, defying gravity
Fabric frozen mid-billow, suspended in time
```

## How to Prompt Effects

**Formula:**
```
[Base scene] + [effect description] + [intensity/quality] + [timing if relevant]
```

**Example:**
```
Forest clearing at dawn; thick ground fog creating mysterious atmosphere; volumetric quality allowing light rays to be visible; At 0:00: fog is dense; At 0:06: begins to dissipate slightly
```
