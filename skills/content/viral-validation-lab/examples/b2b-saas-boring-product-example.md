# Example: B2B SaaS - "Boring" Project Management Tool (60% Controversy)

## Challenge: Make PM Tool Content Viral

**Problem:** Project management is boring, saturated category
**Solution:** Attack the category leader with provocative claims

## Top Content Concept

**"Slack Is Making You Dumber. Here's Why."**

### Script (30 sec):

**Hook (0-3s):**
- Visual: Slack notifications exploding on screen
- Text: "Slack is making you dumber"
- Verbal: "Your team uses Slack. That's the problem."

**Setup (4-15s):**
- Show notification chaos, context-switching research
- "200 interruptions per day = lower IQ than being drunk"
- Demo: Our tool's focus mode

**Payoff (16-30s):**
- Team productivity comparison: With Slack vs Our Tool
- "We built the anti-Slack"
- CTA: "Try it free for 30 days"

### Results:

- 68% completion (lower than taboo products, but good for B2B)
- Comments: 50% agree, 50% defend Slack (PERFECT)
- 2,400 trial signups from content
- Decision: ✅ Validated differentiation angle

## Key Tactics (60% Controversy):

## Why It Worked:
