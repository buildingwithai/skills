# Viral Validation Lab

**Test demand through viral content before building anything.**

An interactive lab where you bring product ideas, features, or creative concepts, and we validate them through viral content—before you spend a dollar on development.

## Overview

The Lab flips the traditional business model: instead of building a product then figuring out marketing, you validate demand through viral content FIRST, then build the product.

**Core Philosophy:**
```
Traditional: Idea → Build → Market → Pray
Content-First: Content → Viral Test → Validate → Build
```

**Two Requirements for Success:**
1. **Strategic Alignment** - Content speaks to ICP, conveys differentiation, uses messaging
2. **Controversy Coefficient** - Pushes boundaries enough to create buzz, shares, arguments

```
Boring + On-Brand = No one cares
Controversial + Off-Brand = Wrong audience
✅ Controversial + On-Brand = VIRAL
```

## Who This Skill Is For

- **Entrepreneurs** validating product ideas before building
- **Product Managers** deciding which features to prioritize (based on content potential)
- **Musicians/Artists** creating viral content for songs/creative work
- **Marketers** generating provocative content concepts
- **Founders** building creator-led brands

## What You'll Get

Bring me:
- A product idea you're considering
- An existing product that needs promotion
- Features you're deciding between
- A song/creative work
- A business concept to validate

I'll help you:
- **Evaluate content potential** (which idea has viral angles?)
- **Generate 10-15 content concepts** (with controversy scores)
- **Prioritize decisions** (build Feature A - 7 content angles vs Feature B's 2)
- **Script actual content** (complete hooks + video outlines)
- **Test and validate** (metrics to track, go/no-go decisions)

## The Controversy Dial (Industry-Based)

Different industries have different boundaries for what's "acceptable":

```
Professional SaaS/B2B: ███░░░░░░░ 60% boundary push
- Edgy, provocative, but defendable
- "We said the quiet part out loud"

Consumer Tech/Apps: ██████░░░░ 80% boundary push
- Provocative, attention-grabbing, shareable
- "This is kinda crazy but..."

Music/Entertainment: █████████░ 95% boundary push
- Bold, unexpected, genre-bending
- "They really did that"

Taboo/Niche Products: ██████████ 100% boundary push
- Embrace the absurdity, lean INTO the taboo
- "I can't believe this exists"
```
