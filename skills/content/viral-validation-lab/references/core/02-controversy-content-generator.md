# 02: Controversy Content Generator

**Use this when:** You have strategic foundation and need 10-15 viral content concepts

**Time:** 1-3 hours

**Output:** Ranked list of content concepts with viral probability scores

---

## Overview

Creating content that "aligns with positioning" isn't enough. It needs to be CONTROVERSIAL enough to spread.

**The Two-Requirement Test:**
1. ✅ **Strategic Alignment** - Speaks to ICP, showcases differentiation, uses messaging framework
2. ✅ **Controversy Coefficient** - Pushes boundaries enough to create buzz, shares, debate

**Remember:**
```
Boring + On-Brand = No one cares
Controversial + Off-Brand = Wrong audience
✅ Controversial + On-Brand = VIRAL
```

---

## STEP 1: Set Your Controversy Dial

Based on your industry/product type, determine how far you can push:

### Professional SaaS/B2B (60% Controversy)

**Boundaries:**
- Edgy but defend able
- Can challenge category norms
- Safe to attack competitors (professionally)
- Avoid: Explicit content, truly offensive claims

**Tactics:**
- "The quiet part out loud" (say what everyone thinks)
- Attack the category leader
- Expose industry "secrets"
- Bold claims with backing

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Slack is making you dumber" (provocative but defendable)
- ✅ "We fired our nicest customer. Here's why." (unexpected)
- ✅ "Your project management tool is the problem" (category attack)
- ❌ "Our competitor's CEO is an idiot" (too personal)

---

### Consumer Tech/Apps (80% Controversy)

**Boundaries:**
- Provocative and attention-grabbing
- Can be playful with taboo topics
- Embrace absurdity
- Avoid: Actually offensive, harmful claims

**Tactics:**
- Forbidden/banned angle ("X doesn't want you to see this")
- Absurdist humor
- Double meanings
- Shock value with purpose

**Examples (Foot Fetish App):**
- ✅ "Tinder banned this. We built it." (forbidden fruit)
- ✅ "The dating app for people with TASTE" (double meaning)
- ✅ "Rating feet is more scientific than rating faces" (absurd claim)
- ❌ Actual explicit content (crosses platform guidelines)

---

### Music/Entertainment (95% Controversy)

**Boundaries:**
- Bold, genre-bending, unexpected
- Challenge cultural norms
- "Rules don't apply" energy
- Avoid: Actually harmful messaging

**Tactics:**
- Genre/cultural mixing controversy
- "I was told not to do this"
- Breaking "rules" of the industry
- Provocative artistic statements

**Examples (Bilingual Artist):**
- ✅ "My Spanish teacher said this was 'bad Spanish.' Now I make $100K with it."
- ✅ "I only rap in Spanglish because English is too limiting" (controversial claim)
- ✅ "Mixing Mexican and Colombian slang pisses everyone off. That's the point."
- ❌ Offensive cultural stereotypes

---

### Taboo/Niche Products (100% Controversy)

**Boundaries:**
- Embrace the absurdity
- Lean INTO the taboo
- Normalize the "weird"
- Avoid: Platform violations (but push close)

**Tactics:**
- "I can't believe this exists" energy
- Take the taboo seriously (paradoxical approach)
- Scientific/educational angle on absurd topic
- Community normalization

**Examples (Foot Fetish App):**
- ✅ "The app your mom warned you about" (embrace it)
- ✅ "We matched 10,000 feet to their soulmates" (absurd stat)
- ✅ "The science behind attractive feet" (serious take on taboo)
- ❌ Actual sexually explicit content

---

## STEP 2: Generate Content Across 3 Tiers

For each idea, create concepts across the controversy spectrum:

### Tier 1: Safe (30-40% Controversy)
**Purpose:** Low risk, establishes credibility, aligns with messaging

**Characteristics:**
- Educational or utility-focused
- Aligns perfectly with positioning
- No controversy, just value

**When to use:**
- Building baseline content
- Nurturing existing audience
- Professional platforms (LinkedIn for B2B)

**Example (B2B SaaS):**
- "5 ways remote teams stay productive"
- Controversy: 30%
- Viral probability: 3/10
- Use case: LinkedIn thought leadership

---

### Tier 2: Spicy (60-75% Controversy)
**Purpose:** Boundary-pushing but defendable, creates debate

**Characteristics:**
- Provocative angle on positioning
- Challenges norms or competitors
- Creates "hot takes" and debate
- Still professional (for B2B) or acceptable (for consumer)

**When to use:**
- Main content strategy
- Building awareness
- Testing boundaries

**Example (B2B SaaS):**
- "Why we BANNED email threads from our platform"
- Controversy: 65%
- Viral probability: 7/10
- Why it works: Controversial product decision, creates debate

**Example (Foot Fetish App):**
- "We matched 10,000 feet to their soulmates"
- Controversy: 70%
- Viral probability: 8/10
- Why it works: Absurd stat, humanizes fetish

---

### Tier 3: Nuclear (80-100% Controversy)
**Purpose:** Maximum boundary push, high risk/high reward

**Characteristics:**
- Highly provocative or absurd
- Will polarize audience (50% love, 50% hate)
- Creates arguments in comments
- Maximum shareability ("Can you believe this?")

**When to use:**
- Testing product viability
- Going for viral moment
- Category creation
- When you have nothing to lose

**Example (B2B SaaS):**
- "We fired our nicest customer. Here's why."
- Controversy: 80%
- Viral probability: 9/10
- Why it works: Unexpected, challenges "customer is always right"

**Example (Foot Fetish App):**
- "Tinder had this feature for 3 days. Then deleted it. We made it the whole app."
- Controversy: 95%
- Viral probability: 9/10
- Why it works: Forbidden angle + category creation

---

## STEP 3: Apply Proven Viral Formats

Take your ideas and structure them using these formats:

### Format 1: Transformation/Before-After

**Structure:**
- Show "before" state (pain/problem)
- Reveal transformation
- Show "after" state (gain/result)

**Best for:** Product demos, personal stories, challenge content

**Example (Foot Fetish App):**
- Title: "Day 1 vs Day 30 of accepting my foot fetish"
- 0-5 sec: "Day 1: Hiding my phone on dating apps"
- 6-15 sec: "Started using [App], found community"
- 16-30 sec: "Day 30: First date with someone who GETS it"
- Controversy: 85%

**Example (B2B SaaS):**
- Title: "Our team before vs after banning Slack"
- Hook: Chaotic notification spam
- Transformation: Switched to our tool
- Result: "2x productivity, zero distractions"
- Controversy: 70%

---

### Format 2: Character/Skit Series

**Structure:**
- Recurring characters represent different perspectives
- One character = old way, one = new way
- OR multiple personas showing product in action

**Best for:** Ongoing series, building audience, demonstrating problems

**Connor Price Example:**
- Characters: Producer, Rapper, "Weird Brother"
- Each has personality, catchphrases
- Creates episodic content

**Example (B2B SaaS):**
- Characters: "Corporate Buzzword Guy" vs "Actually Productive Person"
- Series: Same characters, different scenarios
- Controversy: 60% (gently mocks corporate culture)

**Example (Foot Fetish App):**
- Characters: "Ashamed User" vs "Confident User"
- Journey: Ashamed becomes confident
- Controversy: 80%

---

### Format 3: Challenge/Series

**Structure:**
- "I'm going to do X for Y days"
- Document progress
- Cliffhangers between episodes
- Final result reveal

**Best for:** Building anticipation, repeat viewers, transformation stories

**Example (Music):**
- "I wrote a song using only Spanglish slang from 10 countries - Day 1"
- Episodes 2-6: Add each country
- Episode 7: Final song reveal
- Controversy: 75% (will offend regional purists)

**Example (Any Product):**
- "I used ONLY [product] for 30 days"
- Daily or weekly updates
- Final: "Here's what happened"
- Controversy: Varies by approach

---

### Format 4: Controversial Take/Hot Take

**Structure:**
- Lead with provocative statement
- Back it up with reasoning
- Defend position

**Best for:** Thought leadership, debate generation, positioning

**Example (B2B SaaS):**
- "Unpopular opinion: Your all-hands meetings are making your team DUMBER"
- Controversy: 75%
- Backs up with research
- Positions product as solution

**Example (Bilingual Artist):**
- "English is too limiting for what I want to say. Here's why I ONLY rap in Spanglish."
- Controversy: 90%
- Challenges English-dominance
- Positions artist uniquely

---

### Format 5: Behind-the-Scenes/Expose

**Structure:**
- Reveal "secrets" or internal process
- Humanize the product/creator
- Show what others hide

**Best for:** Building trust, differentiation, transparency positioning

**Example (Foot Fetish App):**
- "Testing our app with 100 strangers. Their reactions..."
- Controversy: 85%
- Shows real reactions (shock, curiosity, acceptance)
- Normalizes through exposure

**Example (B2B SaaS):**
- "Why we BANNED the word 'synergy' from our company Slack"
- Controversy: 60%
- Behind-the-scenes culture
- Positions against corporate BS

---

### Format 6: Educational with Edge

**Structure:**
- Teach something valuable
- BUT with controversial angle or taboo topic
- Make learning entertaining

**Best for:** Authority building, SEO, long-tail content

**Example (Foot Fetish App):**
- "The science of attractive feet - we analyzed 100,000 feet"
- Controversy: 90%
- Takes taboo topic seriously
- Educational + absurd = shareable

**Example (Music):**
- "Why mixing Colombian and Mexican slang pisses everyone off (and why I do it anyway)"
- Controversy: 85%
- Educational about language/culture
- Defends controversial choice

---

## STEP 4: Generate Your 10-15 Concepts

Use this template for each concept:

```markdown
## Concept #[Number]: [Title]

**Format:** [Transformation, Skit, Challenge, etc.]

**Tier:** [1-Safe, 2-Spicy, 3-Nuclear]

**Hook (0-3 seconds):**
- Visual: [What they SEE]
- Text overlay: [Words on screen]
- Verbal: [What you SAY]

**Setup (4-15 seconds):**
- [What happens next]
- [Pattern interrupt at 5-7 sec mark]

**Payoff (16-30 seconds):**
- [Resolution/reveal]
- [CTA or cliffhanger]

**Why it works:**
- Strategic alignment: [How it showcases positioning]
- Controversy element: [What's provocative]
- Share trigger: [Why people will share]

**Scores:**
- Strategic Alignment (1-10): [X]
- Controversy Level (1-10): [Y]
- Viral Probability (1-10): [Z]
- Production Difficulty (1-10): [A]
- Risk Level (1-10): [B]

**Total Score:** [X+Y+Z-A-B = Final]
```

---

## STEP 5: Score & Rank Your Concepts

Score each concept across 5 dimensions:

### 1. Strategic Alignment (1-10)
- Does it showcase positioning?
- Does it speak to ICP?
- Does it use messaging framework?
- 10 = Perfect alignment, 1 = Off-brand

### 2. Controversy Level (1-10)
- How boundary-pushing is it?
- Will it create debate?
- Does it challenge norms?
- 10 = Nuclear, 1 = Safe

### 3. Viral Probability (1-10)
- Hook strength (3-second test)
- Share-ability (why would someone share?)
- Uniqueness (has this been done?)
- 10 = Highly viral, 1 = Won't spread

### 4. Production Difficulty (1-10)
- Resources needed?
- Time to create?
- Technical complexity?
- 10 = Very difficult, 1 = Easy (INVERSE SCORING)

### 5. Risk Level (1-10)
- Could this backfire?
- Platform violation risk?
- Brand damage potential?
- 10 = High risk, 1 = Safe (INVERSE SCORING)

### Calculate Final Score:
```
Final Score = (Strategic Alignment + Controversy + Viral Probability) - (Production Difficulty + Risk Level)

Maximum: 30 - 2 = 28
Minimum: 3 - 20 = -17
```

**Rank concepts by final score**

## Common Mistakes

**❌ Generating only Tier 1 (safe) concepts**
- Won't go viral, defeats purpose
- Need Tier 2-3 for buzz

**❌ All controversy, no strategy**
- Might go viral but wrong audience
- Need strategic alignment

**❌ Copying competitors' formats**
- Need unique angle
- Can use structure, not content

**❌ Not scoring objectively**
- "I like this one" ≠ viral probability
- Use framework
