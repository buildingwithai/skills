# 01: Strategic Foundation Gathering

**Use this when:** Starting from scratch with an idea, product, or song

**Time:** 2-4 hours total

**Output:** Strategic brief that informs all content decisions

---

## Overview

Before generating viral content, you need strategic foundation. This prevents creating content that:
- Targets the wrong audience
- Fails to showcase what makes you unique
- Uses messaging that doesn't resonate

**The Foundation Trinity:**
1. **ICP/Personas** - WHO shares your content?
2. **Positioning** - WHAT makes you different? (The contentable angle)
3. **Messaging** - HOW to communicate value? (Hook structure)

---

## Step 1: Define ICP/Personas (30-60 min)

### Call the Positioning Skill

**Action:** Use the `positioning` skill → ICP Analysis section

**What to extract for content strategy:**

#### Standard ICP Questions:
- Who is your best-fit customer?
- What's their role/demographics?
- What problems do they have?

#### **Content-Specific Questions** (Add these):

**Q1: Who shares content in this category?**
- Example (B2B SaaS): Product managers who want to look smart
- Example (Foot fetish app): People comfortable with their fetish, want community
- Example (Bilingual artist): Latinos tired of being put in regional boxes

**Q2: What platforms do they use for content discovery?**
- TikTok? LinkedIn? Instagram? YouTube?
- Where are they most active?
- What time of day?

**Q3: What content do they currently engage with?**
- Educational? Entertainment? Controversy?
- Do they share memes? Long-form? Short-form?

**Q4: What's taboo vs acceptable in their world?**
- B2B LinkedIn: Can be edgy, but stay professional
- Consumer TikTok: Can be provocative
- Niche/Taboo products: Can push hard

**Q5: What would make them share something?**
- "This is so me" (identity expression)
- "Everyone needs to see this" (utility)
- "Can you believe this?" (shock/controversy)
- "This is hilarious" (humor)

### Template: ICP Brief for Content

```markdown
## ICP Content Profile

**Who they are:**
- [Demographics, role, context]

**Content behavior:**
- Primary platforms: [TikTok, LinkedIn, etc.]
- Engagement style: [Sharers, commenters, lurkers]
- Share triggers: [What makes them hit share?]

**Boundaries:**
- Taboo topics: [What to avoid]
- Acceptable controversy level: [60-100%]
- Tone preferences: [Professional, casual, absurd]

**Content examples they engage with:**
- [Link 3-5 viral examples in your category]
- What made these work?
```

## Step 2: Clarify Positioning (1-2 hours)

### Call the Positioning Skill

**Action:** Use the `positioning` skill → April Dunford Framework

**What to extract for content strategy:**

#### Standard Positioning Outputs:
- Competitive alternatives
- Unique features/capabilities
- Value/benefits
- Best-fit customer

#### **Content Angles to Identify:**

**From Competitive Alternatives:**
- "X vs Y" content opportunity
- Example: "Paper notebooks vs AI notes" (before/after potential)
- Example: "Tinder vs Feet-focused app" (category creation)

**From Unique Features:**
- What can you SHOW that competitors can't?
- What's your "carrot flute" moment? (Connor Price's unique instrument hook)
- What's visually interesting?

**From Differentiation:**
- What's controversial about your positioning?
- Example: "We're the ANTI-Slack" (attack the leader)
- Example: "Feet matter more than faces" (provocative claim)

### Template: Positioning for Content

```markdown
## Positioning Content Angles

**Competitive Alternative:**
- What we replace: [Paper, Tinder, Spreadsheets, etc.]
- Contentable moment: [Show before/after, old way vs new way]

**Unique Value:**
- The "wow" factor: [What makes people say "that's cool"]
- Visual demonstration: [How to show it in 3 seconds]
- Provocative framing: [Controversial way to state it]

**Best-fit Customer Story:**
- Who has the biggest transformation?
- What's their before/after narrative?
- Can we show this visually?

**Differentiation Statement (Provocative Version):**
- Standard: [Normal positioning statement]
- Provocative: [Boundary-pushing version for content]
  - Example: "Project management tool that respects your focus" → "We built the anti-Slack because Slack is making you dumber"
```

---

## Step 3: Develop Messaging Framework (1-2 hours)

### Call the Messaging Skill

**Action:** Use the `messaging` skill → Pain-Claim-Gain Framework

**What to extract for content structure:**

#### Standard Messaging Outputs:
- Pain points per audience
- Claims (what you do/offer)
- Gains (outcomes/benefits)

#### **Content Hook Structure:**

The Pain-Claim-Gain framework IS your viral video structure:

```
PAIN = HOOK (0-3 seconds)
  ↓
CLAIM = SETUP (4-15 seconds)
  ↓
GAIN = PAYOFF (16-30 seconds)
```

**Example (B2B SaaS):**
- Pain: "Design feedback lost in Slack threads" → HOOK: Designer scrolling 500 messages
- Claim: "All feedback in visual timeline" → SETUP: Show the tool
- Gain: "Ship 2x faster" → PAYOFF: "Done in half the time"

**Example (Foot Fetish App):**
- Pain: "Ashamed of foot fetish, can't be open" → HOOK: Person hiding phone screen
- Claim: "Judgment-free community" → SETUP: Show app, matching
- Gain: "Find matches who get it" → PAYOFF: "Finally, someone who appreciates..."

### Template: Messaging for Hooks

```markdown
## Messaging Hook Map

**Primary Audience: [Name]**

Pain → Hook (0-3 sec):
- Emotional pain: [Feeling]
- Visual representation: [What we SHOW]
- Hook text overlay: [Words on screen]
- Verbal hook: [What we SAY]

Claim → Setup (4-15 sec):
- What we offer: [Solution]
- How to demo: [Show the product/service]
- Surprise element: [What's unexpected?]

Gain → Payoff (16-30 sec):
- Outcome: [Result]
- Proof point: [Stat, testimonial, demo]
- CTA: [What to do next]

**Secondary Audience: [Name]**
[Repeat structure with different pain-claim-gain]
```

## Common Mistakes

**❌ Skipping straight to content ideas**
- Without strategic foundation, content won't align or convert

**❌ Using only "safe" positioning**
- "A better project management tool" has no contentable angle
- Need provocative version: "The anti-Slack"

**❌ Ignoring audience's content behavior**
- LinkedIn audience won't share TikTok-style absurdist content
- Match format to platform

**❌ Not defining controversy boundaries**
- Too safe = won't go viral
- Too far = backlash
- Use ICP research to set dial
