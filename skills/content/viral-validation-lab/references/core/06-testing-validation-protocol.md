# 06: Testing & Validation Protocol

**Use this when:** Content is created - measuring if it validates your product idea

**Time:** 48-hour measurement window (after 1 week of creation)

**Output:** Go/No-Go decision backed by data

---

## Overview

Content performance = demand validation

**The Validation Thesis:**
If people won't watch/share content ABOUT your product...
They won't buy/use the ACTUAL product.

---

## STEP 1: Create 3 Variations (A/B/C Test)

Don't test just one concept - test variations:

**Version A:** Tier 2 concept (Spicy - 60-75% controversy)
**Version B:** Tier 3 concept (Nuclear - 80-100% controversy)  
**Version C:** Different hook/format of Tier 2

**Why 3?**
- Isolates what works (hook vs concept vs format)
- Reduces false negatives (one bad execution ≠ bad idea)
- Shows range of audience tolerance

---

## STEP 2: Post & Measure (48-Hour Window)

### Primary Metrics (Success Indicators):

**1. Completion Rate** (Most Important)
- **Target:** 75%+ (people watch to the end)
- **Measurement:** Platform analytics (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram)
- **Why it matters:** If they don't finish, content didn't hook them
- **How to check:**
  - TikTok: Average watch time / video length
  - YouTube Shorts: Watch time report
  - Instagram Reels: Plays / Reach

**2. Share Rate** (Viral Indicator)
- **Target:** 5%+ of views result in shares
- **Why it matters:** Shares = people want others to see it
- **Good controversy:** High shares even if mixed comments
- **Calculation:** (Shares / Views) × 100

**3. Engagement Velocity** (Algorithm Boost)
- **Target:** 1,000 views in first 60 minutes
- **Why it matters:** Signals to algorithm to push further
- **Platforms:** Especially critical on TikTok
- **What to track:** View count at 1hr, 6hr, 24hr, 48hr marks

**4. Comment Sentiment** (Controversy Quality)
- **Target:** 40-60% split (some love, some debate)
- **Why it matters:** Polarization = engagement = spread
- **Red flags:** 90%+ negative (wrong controversy) OR 90%+ generic positive (too safe)

### Secondary Metrics:

- Profile visits (interest in you/brand)
- Link clicks (if CTA included)
- Saves/bookmarks (intent to return)
- Follower growth from video

---

## STEP 3: Read the Controversy Signals

### ✅ GOOD CONTROVERSY (Proceed to Build)

**Signals:**
- Comments: 40-60% love it, 40-60% debate/disagree
- Shares: High (people want others to weigh in)
- Completion: 75%+
- Sentiment examples:
  - "This is genius but also crazy"
  - "I can't believe this exists"
  - "They really said that!"
  - Mix of supporters and skeptics

**Example (Foot Fetish App):**
- 72% completion rate
- 8% share rate
- Comments:
  - 45%: "This is genius, finally!"
  - 45%: "WTF did I just watch"
  - 10%: "This can't be real"
- **Decision:** ✅ BUILD THE APP

---

### ⚠️ WRONG CONTROVERSY (Pivot or Iterate)

**Signals:**
- Comments: 80%+ negative, not engaging negative
- Shares: Low (people don't want to be associated)
- Completion: Mixed (40-60%)
- Sentiment examples:
  - "This is offensive"
  - "Delete this"
  - "This isn't funny"
  - Actual backlash, not playful debate

**What to do:**
- Review: Did we cross a line?
- Pivot: Try Tier 2 (less controversial) version
- Reframe: Same idea, different angle

**Example (Hypothetical B2B SaaS):**
- "Your employees are the problem" - TOO personal, felt mean
- Pivot to: "Your tools are making employees less productive"
- Same insight, less attacking

---

### ❌ NO CONTROVERSY (Failed - Too Safe)

**Signals:**
- Comments: Generic ("cool" "nice" "interesting")
- Shares: Very low (<1%)
- Completion: <50%
- Sentiment: Apathetic, not engaged

**What to do:**
- Abandon this approach
- Go back to 02-controversy-generator
- Push boundaries MORE, not less

**Example:**
- "5 ways to improve productivity" - Boring, done before
- Nobody shares because nothing provocative
- **Decision:** ❌ ABANDON, try nuclear concept instead

---

## STEP 4: Decision Matrix

| Completion | Share Rate | Comment Split | Decision |
|------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| 75%+ | 5%+ | 40-60% split | ✅ BUILD PRODUCT |
| 75%+ | 5%+ | 80%+ positive | ⚠️ SAFE - Push boundaries more |
| 75%+ | <2% | Generic comments | ⚠️ NOT VIRAL - Iterate |
| 50-74% | 3-5% | Mixed | ⚠️ ITERATE CONTENT - Try again |
| <50% | <2% | Apathetic | ❌ ABANDON CONCEPT |
| Any | High | 80%+ negative | ❌ WRONG CONTROVERSY - Pivot |

---

## STEP 5: Make the Go/No-Go Decision

### ✅ GO (Build the Product)

**Criteria met:**
- At least 1 of 3 variations hit 75%+ completion
- Share velocity indicates virality
- Comments show healthy controversy (debate, not backlash)
- Profile visits/follows increased

**Next steps:**
1. Document what worked (which variation, why)
2. Create 5-10 more content pieces in winning format
3. Begin product development
4. Use content to build waitlist during development
5. Launch with content momentum

---

### ⚠️ ITERATE (Try Different Approach)

**Criteria:**
- 50-75% completion (okay but not great)
- Some engagement but not viral
- Comments show interest but confusion

**Next steps:**
1. Analyze: What worked? What didn't?
2. Adjust: Different hook? Format? Controversy level?
3. Test 3 more variations
4. Repeat measurement
5. Decision after round 2

**Iteration limit:** Max 2 rounds of testing
- If still not hitting metrics after 6 variations total → Likely not contentable enough

---

### ❌ ABANDON (Kill the Idea)

**Criteria:**
- <50% completion across all variations
- Minimal shares
- Apathetic or negative response
- No profile interest

**Next steps:**
1. Accept that idea isn't contentable enough
2. Return to ideation (02-controversy-generator)
3. Try different product/feature angle
4. OR: Consider if idea is viable through traditional marketing (but defeats purpose of this skill)

**Key insight:** Better to kill idea after $500 in content creation than $50K in product development

---

## Platform-Specific Benchmarks

### TikTok
- **Completion target:** 80%+ (algorithm heavily weights this)
- **Velocity:** 1K views in 1 hour = good, 10K in 6 hours = viral
- **Engagement:** Comments + shares matter more than likes

### YouTube Shorts
- **Completion target:** 70%+ (slightly more forgiving)
- **Velocity:** Slower build than TikTok, watch 24-48 hour performance
- **Subscribers:** Track subscriber growth from Shorts

### Instagram Reels
- **Completion target:** 75%+
- **Velocity:** Reach vs Followers ratio (10:1 = viral potential)
- **Saves:** High saves = content has utility/rewatch value

---

## Testing Timeline

**Day 1: Post Content**
- Morning: Post Version A
- Afternoon: Post Version B (different platform or 6hrs later)
- Evening: Post Version C

**Day 2-3: Monitor**
- Track metrics every 6 hours
- Screenshot analytics
- Read comments (don't engage yet)

**Day 4: Analyze**
- Compare all 3 variations
- Identify winner
- Make preliminary decision

**Day 5-7: Validate**
- Post 2-3 more variations of winner
- Confirm consistency
- Final Go/No-Go decision

---

## Real Example: Foot Fetish App Results

### Version A: "Tinder Banned This"
**Metrics (48 hours):**
- Views: 487K
- Completion: 78%
- Shares: 38K (7.8% share rate)
- Comments: 12K
  - 42% positive: "Genius idea"
  - 45% shocked: "This can't be real"
  - 13% negative: "Why does this exist"
- Profile visits: +15K
- Link clicks: 4.2K

**Analysis:** ✅ STRONG VALIDATION

---

### Version B: "Science of Attractive Feet"
**Metrics (48 hours):**
- Views: 312K
- Completion: 71%
- Shares: 18K (5.8% share rate)
- Comments: 8K
  - Educational angle resonated
  - Less polarizing than Version A
- Profile visits: +8K

**Analysis:** ✅ GOOD but less viral than A

---

### Version C: "10,000 Feet Matched"
**Metrics (48 hours):**
- Views: 156K
- Completion: 65%
- Shares: 4K (2.6% share rate)
- Comments: 2K
  - More generic responses

**Analysis:** ⚠️ WEAKEST but still positive

---

**DECISION:** ✅ BUILD THE APP

**Reasoning:**
- Version A crushed benchmarks (78% completion, 7.8% shares)
- Healthy controversy (mixed comments, high engagement)
- Strong interest signals (15K profile visits, 4.2K link clicks)
- Consistent performance across variations (all positive)

**Next steps:**
1. Create 10 more "Tinder Banned This" angle content pieces
2. Build MVP while content builds audience
3. Launch with 50K+ aware audience from content

---

## Common Mistakes

**❌ Testing only 1 variation**
- One bad execution ≠ bad idea
- Need multiple data points

**❌ Measuring too early**
- Give it 48 hours minimum
- TikTok especially can spike late

**❌ Ignoring comment sentiment**
- All engagement isn't equal
- Backlash ≠ healthy controversy

**❌ Not having clear decision criteria**
- "It did okay" - what does that mean?
- Use the matrix above

**❌ Falling in love with the idea**
- Data says no but you proceed anyway
- Trust the metrics

---

## Checklist: Ready to Decide?
