# Crisis Management: When Controversy Goes Wrong

## Red Flags

**Wrong Controversy:**
- 80%+ truly negative comments (not playful debate)
- Shares dropping despite views
- Platform warnings/violations
- Calls to "cancel" you

## Decision Tree

**Q: Was the controversy strategic?**
YES → Defend with data
NO → Apologize quickly

**Q: Did you cross ethical lines?**
YES → Apologize, delete, pivot
NO → Explain intent, reframe

**Q: Is the backlash from target audience or others?**
TARGET AUDIENCE → Problem, need to pivot
OTHERS → Might be fine, they weren't the audience anyway

## Recovery Strategies

**Apology Template:**
"We hear you. [What we intended] vs [how it landed]. Here's what we're changing: [action]."

**Doubling Down (When Appropriate):**
"We knew this would be controversial. Here's why we stand by it: [reasoning with data]."

**Pivot:**
Delete, wait 48 hours, post Tier 2 (less controversial) version with lessons learned.
