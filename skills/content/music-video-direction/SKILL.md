→ Reference: Camera-angle-quick-reference, lens-choice-guide

### "What type of music video should I make?"

**When the song tells a clear story:**
→ **NARRATIVE** approach
→ Read: 02-theory-frameworks (narrative section) → advanced/narrative-storytelling
→ Consider: Linear or non-linear? Artist as character or separate actors?

**When the artist's performance is central:**
→ **PERFORMANCE** approach
→ Read: 02-theory-frameworks (performance section) → advanced/performance-direction
→ Consider: Studio or live setting? Single location or multiple?

**When you want abstract, artistic, surreal:**
→ **CONCEPTUAL** approach
→ Read: 02-theory-frameworks (conceptual section) → 07-surreal-jarring-imagery
→ Consider: What's the central metaphor or idea?

**When you want the best of multiple approaches:**
→ **HYBRID** approach (most common)
→ Read: 02-theory-frameworks (hybrid section)
→ Consider: What ratio? (e.g., 60% narrative, 40% performance)

### "How do lyrics relate to visuals?" (Andrew Goodwin)

**ILLUSTRATE** - Visuals show exactly what lyrics describe:
- "Walking down the street" → Artist literally walking down street
- Best for: Narrative clarity, literal storytelling
- Risk: Can be too obvious, less creative

**AMPLIFY** - Visuals enhance and expand lyrical meaning:
- "Heartbreak" → Visuals of broken mirrors, wilting flowers, rain
- Best for: Emotional resonance, metaphorical depth
- Most common approach in professional videos

**CONTRADICT** - Visuals present opposite or contrast to lyrics:
- Singing about happiness → Dark, melancholic visuals
- Best for: Irony, creating tension, surprise
- Risk: Can confuse if not intentional

**Which to choose?**
- Powerful lyrics: ILLUSTRATE to ensure message lands
- Abstract emotions: AMPLIFY with visual metaphors
- Ironic/satirical songs: CONTRADICT for effect
- Most videos: Mix of AMPLIFY (60-70%) + ILLUSTRATE (20-30%) + occasional CONTRADICT (10%)

## Key Principles

### 1. Listen Before You Visualize

You cannot create authentic visuals without deeply understanding the song. Listen 10-20 times:
- Focus on lyrics only (what story is told?)
- Focus on melody only (what emotions arise?)
- Focus on production (what textures and energy?)
- Focus on artist intent (what are they trying to say?)

### 2. The First 5 Seconds Determine Everything

Most viewers decide to keep watching within 5-10 seconds. Your opening must:
- Create visual intrigue (pattern interruption)
- Establish mood immediately
- Tease the concept without revealing all
- Use your most striking imagery

### 3. Surreal Doesn't Mean Random

Jarring, uncomfortable imagery works when it serves the song's emotion or concept:
- **Good surreal**: Person on stool in ocean = isolation, vulnerability, absurdity of the situation in lyrics
- **Bad surreal**: Random astronaut appears for no reason = confusing, disconnected

Every surreal choice should amplify the song's meaning.

### 4. Genre Conventions Are Guidelines, Not Rules

Understanding conventions helps you make intentional choices:
- **Follow conventions** when you want immediate genre recognition
- **Subvert conventions** when you want to stand out or make a statement
- **Ignore conventions** when the song itself breaks genre boundaries

### 5. Sora Prompts Need Specificity

Vague prompts create unpredictable results. Every prompt should specify:
- Exact camera position and movement
- Precise timing of actions (at 0:00, at 0:03, etc.)
- Lighting direction and quality
- Color palette and grading
- What NOT to include (exclusions)
- Audio cues synchronized to visual beats

### 6. Emotion Drives Every Decision

Every choice - camera angle, color, location, wardrobe, lighting - should serve the song's emotional core:
- Vulnerability → Close-ups, soft lighting, intimate spaces
- Power → Low angles, high contrast, bold colors
- Confusion → Dutch angles, disorienting cuts, unstable camera
- Joy → Bright colors, movement, wide shots
- Melancholy → Cool tones, slow motion, empty spaces

### 7. Repetition With Variation

Choruses repeat, but visuals shouldn't be identical:
- **Chorus 1**: Establish the core imagery
- **Chorus 2**: Same concept, different angle or slight variation
- **Final Chorus**: Biggest, most evolved version

This creates familiarity while building energy.

### 8. Timing Is Music Video Grammar

In music videos, time follows music, not reality:
- Cut on beats, not arbitrary moments
- Use tempo to determine shot duration
- Match camera movement speed to BPM
- Sync action peaks to musical peaks (chorus drop, drum hit, etc.)

### 9. Treatments Sell Vision, Not Details

When pitching to artists/labels:
- Lead with mood and feeling, not technical specs
- Use lots of visual references (images, video links)
- Keep text punchy and succinct
- Focus on what the viewer will feel
- Show you understand the artist's brand

### 10. 10 Seconds Is Both Limiting and Liberating

Sora's 10-second constraint forces clarity:
- One clear idea per clip (not three)
- Simplified action progression
- Focus on the essential moment
- Strategic clip sequencing becomes critical

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Starting with visuals before understanding the song** → Leads to disconnected, music-less videos
2. **Too many ideas in one video** → Dilutes impact; pick one strong concept
3. **Ignoring the artist's brand and visual identity** → Creates videos that feel off-brand
4. **Generic genre clichés without intention** → Makes your video forgettable
5. **Vague Sora prompts** → Unpredictable results, wasted generation time
6. **No timing synchronization** → Visuals that don't land on musical beats feel wrong
7. **Forgetting the hook** → Viewers leave in first 10 seconds
8. **Surreal for surreal's sake** → Confuses rather than enhances
9. **Wrong color grading for emotion** → Bright colors on sad song, dark on happy song
10. **Skipping the treatment** → Jumping to prompts without clear concept documentation

## Example Workflow: Lyrics to Sora Prompts

**Song**: 3:30 indie-pop track about feeling isolated in a crowded city

**Step 1: Listen & Analyze** (Day 1)
- Listen 15 times
- Note emotional beats: Verses (lonely), Chorus (desperate cry for connection), Bridge (acceptance)
- Identify key lyrics: "Surrounded by a million faces, but I'm the only one here"

**Step 2: Conceptualize** (Days 2-3)
- Type: Hybrid (70% conceptual, 30% performance)
- Core concept: Artist visible but separated from crowds by invisible barrier/glass
- Surreal element: Crowds move in fast-motion, artist in slow-motion
- Color palette: Desaturated blues and grays with warm spot on artist

**Step 3: Map Structure** (Day 4)
- Intro (0-15s): Wide shot, artist alone in empty space [2 clips]
- Verse 1 (15-45s): Crowds appear but ignore artist [3 clips]
- Chorus (55-1:20): Glass barrier revealed, artist trying to break through [3 clips]
- Verse 2: Artist walking through crowd, invisible [3 clips]
- Chorus 2: Same barrier, more desperate [3 clips]
- Bridge: Artist stops trying, sits down in middle of rushing crowd [2 clips]
- Final Chorus: Barrier shatters or acceptance [4 clips]
- Outro: Artist alone again but different emotion [1 clip]
Total: 21 clips

**Step 4: Scene Design** (Days 5-7)
- Location: Urban intersection, subway platform, crowded plaza
- Wardrobe: Artist in muted gray coat, crowd in sharp black/white
- Camera: Mix of wide establishing shots and intimate close-ups
- Lighting: Soft key light on artist, harsh overhead on crowds

**Step 5: Sora Prompts** (Days 8-10)
Example prompt for Chorus scene:

```
A crowded urban intersection at dusk; medium close-up of woman in gray coat, face pressed against invisible glass barrier; 35mm lens, shallow depth of field, camera slowly pushing in; background crowds rush past in 3x speed time-lapse while subject moves in slow motion; cool desaturated blue-gray color palette with warm orange key light on subject's face creating contrast; At 0:00: woman's hands touch invisible surface, slight fog appears where skin meets barrier; At 0:03: she begins to push harder, expression shifting from hope to frustration; At 0:06: fist pounds against glass in sync with drum hit, small cracks spider out; At 0:09: she pulls back, defeated, as crowds blur past. Soft breathing audio at 0:01, desperate vocalization crescendos from 0:03 to 0:08, drum impact at 0:06. No lens flare, maintain natural skin tones, ensure glass barrier is subtly visible through light refraction.
```

**Step 6: Refinement** (Days 11-12)
- Review all 21 prompts for consistency
- Ensure timing matches song beats exactly
- Verify emotional progression across clips
- Check color palette consistency

## Support & Customization

This skill is designed to be adapted:

- **Scale to song length**: Adjust number of clips for 2-minute vs 5-minute songs
- **Match your tools**: Prompts work for Sora but principles apply to any AI video tool
- **Budget considerations**: Frameworks work for low-budget (Sora-only) or high-budget (hybrid) approaches
- **Artist collaboration**: Templates include artist questionnaires and collaboration guides
- **Genre flexibility**: Every genre covered, plus how to blend or subvert

The frameworks are research-based and proven, but creativity is personal.
