# Multi-Video Campaign Planning

## When One Video Isn't Enough

For albums, EPs, or artist brand building, plan multiple videos as cohesive campaign.

## Visual Continuity Strategies

### Same Visual World
**Approach:** All videos exist in same universe/aesthetic
**Example:** Same color palette, similar locations, consistent visual style
**Advantage:** Builds recognizable brand

### Evolving Narrative
**Approach:** Each video continues story from previous
**Example:** Video 1 = character alone, Video 2 = meets someone, Video 3 = journey together
**Advantage:** Keeps fans engaged across releases

### Different Perspectives
**Approach:** Same story, different character viewpoints
**Example:** Video 1 = person A's view, Video 2 = person B's view of same events
**Advantage:** Deeper storytelling, rewatch value

### Thematic Variations
**Approach:** Same theme explored differently
**Example:** Theme = isolation, Video 1 = urban, Video 2 = nature, Video 3 = internal
**Advantage:** Depth without redundancy

### Contrasting Approaches
**Approach:** Intentionally different per song
**Example:** Upbeat song = colorful, sad song = monochrome
**Advantage:** Shows range, serves each song individually

## Planning for Sora Efficiency

**Batch production advantages:**
- Develop prompt library once
- Consistent style through similar descriptions
- Reuse successful environmental prompts
- Build visual motif library

**Example shared elements:**
- Same color grading description across all videos
- Same void/environment with variations
- Recurring visual motifs (red balloon, specific object)
- Similar camera approaches

## Campaign Timeline

**Single video:** 2-3 weeks
**3-video campaign:** 4-6 weeks (efficiency from shared approach)
**Full album (10+ videos):** 2-3 months with batch workflow

## Cohesion Without Redundancy

**Unify through:**
- Color palette consistency
- Similar camera approaches
- Recurring motif or object
- Same artist wardrobe aesthetic
- Consistent surreal approach

**Vary through:**
- Different settings per video
- Different conceptual metaphors
- Different energy levels matching songs
- Evolution of shared motifs

## Campaign Checklist

- [ ] Does each video work standalone?
- [ ] Is there clear connection between videos?
- [ ] Do they showcase artistic range while maintaining identity?
- [ ] Can they be produced efficiently in batch?
- [ ] Does campaign tell larger story than individual videos?

**For multi-video campaigns:** Plan all concepts upfront, identify shared elements, batch produce with Sora for efficiency.
