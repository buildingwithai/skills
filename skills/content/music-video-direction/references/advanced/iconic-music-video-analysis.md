# Iconic Music Video Analysis

## Learning from the Masters

Studying iconic music videos reveals patterns, techniques, and creative approaches that work.

## What Makes a Music Video "Iconic"

1. **Memorable imagery** - One unforgettable visual
2. **Serves the song** - Enhances rather than distracts
3. **Cultural impact** - Referenced, parodied, influential
4. **Innovative for its time** - Pushed boundaries
5. **Rewatchability** - Reveals more on repeat viewings

## Key Lessons from Legendary Videos

**Example references:** Björk's work, FKA twigs, Radiohead
**Lesson:** Strong central concept executed fully beats scattered ideas
**Application:** Choose ONE strong idea, explore it deeply

**Lesson:** Raw authentic performance can be enough
**Application:** Don't overcomplicate if performance is strong

**Application:** Focus on feeling, not plot complexity

### The Surreal/Artistic
