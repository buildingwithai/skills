# Editing Pace and Transitions

## Editing for Music Videos

Music videos are unique: the music dictates the edit, not dramatic logic.

## Pace Fundamentals

### Cut Frequency by BPM
**60-80 BPM:** Cut every 2-3 seconds (slow, contemplative)
**80-100 BPM:** Cut every 1.5-2 seconds (moderate)
**100-120 BPM:** Cut every 1-1.5 seconds (energetic)
**120-140 BPM:** Cut every 0.5-1 second (fast, dynamic)
**140+ BPM:** Cut every 0.5 seconds or faster (frenetic)

### Cutting on the Beat

**Most common:** Cut exactly on beat
**Advanced:** Cut slightly before beat (creates urgency)
**Deliberate:** Cut off-beat (creates unease)

## Transition Types

### HARD CUT (Standard)
**What:** Instant switch between shots
**When:** 90% of music video transitions
**Effect:** Direct, energetic, keeps pace

### CROSS DISSOLVE
**What:** Gradual fade between shots
**When:** Slower songs, dreamlike moments, time passage
**Effect:** Smooth, contemplative, ethereal

### MATCH CUT
**What:** Cut between similar compositions/shapes/movements
**When:** Artistic connections, metaphors
**Effect:** Clever, artistic, creates meaning
**Example:** Eye → Tunnel opening

### WHIP PAN
**What:** Fast camera movement blur transition
**When:** High energy, rapid location change
**Effect:** Dynamic, energetic, sudden

### SMASH CUT
**What:** Sudden cut to radically different scene/energy
**When:** Shock, surprise, dramatic contrast
**Effect:** Jarring, attention-grabbing

### FADE TO BLACK/WHITE
**What:** Image fades to solid color
**When:** Section endings, dramatic pauses, outro
**Effect:** Finality, breath, reset

## Pacing Strategies

### ACCELERATING
Shots get progressively shorter as song builds
**When:** Building tension, climax approach

### DECELERATING
Shots get progressively longer
**When:** Wind down, resolution, calm

### RHYTHMIC/STEADY
Consistent shot duration throughout
**When:** Hypnotic effect, consistent energy

### CHAOTIC
Random/unpredictable shot durations
**When:** Chaos, anxiety, energy

## Editing by Song Section

**VERSE:** Longer shots, breathing room, narrative focus
**PRE-CHORUS:** Accelerating cuts
**CHORUS:** Fast cuts OR powerful sustained shots (depends on energy)
**BRIDGE:** Different pace from rest (surprise)

## For Sora Workflow

**You're pre-editing with prompts:**
- Each 10-second clip IS an edit decision
- Plan cut points when designing clips
- Align clip boundaries with song structure

**In post-editing:**
- Trim Sora clips to exact lengths needed
- Cut on beats
- Add transitions between clips
- Refine timing

## Common Editing Mistakes

❌ **Cutting off-beat unintentionally**
✅ **Deliberate beat alignment**

❌ **Too many transition types** (visual chaos)
✅ **Mostly hard cuts, selective special transitions**

❌ **Fighting the music's pace**
✅ **Edit pace matches song energy**

❌ **Random shot durations**
✅ **Intentional pacing strategy**

## Quick Guidelines

**Fast song:** Fast cuts, hard transitions, rhythmic
**Slow song:** Longer shots, dissolves allowed, contemplative
**Building song:** Accelerating cuts toward peak
**Chaotic song:** Match the chaos (or contrast with stability)

**Remember:** In music videos, the music is the editor. Your job is to serve the song's rhythm.
