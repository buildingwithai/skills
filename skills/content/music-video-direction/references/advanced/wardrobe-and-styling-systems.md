# Wardrobe and Styling Systems

## Costume as Character

Wardrobe choices communicate identity, emotion, and transformation instantly.

## Color Psychology in Wardrobe

**RED:** Passion, power, danger, love, anger
**BLUE:** Calm, sadness, trust, distance
**BLACK:** Power, mystery, elegance, void
**WHITE:** Purity, innocence, emptiness, new beginning
**GRAY:** Neutrality, depression, transition
**BRIGHT COLORS:** Joy, youth, energy
**MUTED COLORS:** Melancholy, sophistication, indie aesthetic

## Wardrobe Strategies

### Single Outfit Throughout
**Effect:** Unity, focus on concept over costume
**When:** Conceptual videos, emphasis on other elements
**Example:** Same gray coat entire video

### Multiple Outfit Changes
**Effect:** Transformation, different personas, section variation
**When:** High-budget pop, transformation narratives
**Example:** Verse 1 = casual, Chorus = glam, Bridge = stripped down

### Transformation Within Video
**Effect:** Character arc visualization
**When:** Growth/change themes
**Example:** Start buttoned-up formal → End flowing free clothing

### Symbolic Costume
**Effect:** Immediate meaning
**When:** Metaphorical approach
**Example:** Armor = emotional protection, Wings = freedom/angel

## Genre Conventions

**Pop:** Bright, fashionable, multiple changes, trendy
**Hip-Hop:** Designer brands, jewelry, expensive, aspirational
**Rock:** Casual, authentic, band tees, leather, less polished
**R&B:** Sophisticated, sensual, tailored, luxurious fabrics
**Indie:** Understated, vintage, thrift, authentic, less logo-focused
**Country:** Denim, boots, authentic workwear, relatable

## Wardrobe for Sora Prompts

**Describe precisely:**
```
Woman in flowing red silk dress, fabric billowing in wind
Man in worn gray wool coat, collar turned up
Figure in all black, silhouetted against white background
```

**What works in AI:**
- Strong color contrasts
- Distinctive silhouettes
- Flowing fabrics (visual interest)
- Simple bold choices

**What's challenging:**
- Brand logos (generic instead)
- Intricate patterns (keep simple)
- Exact replicas of real outfits

## Wardrobe Symbolism

**Formal Clothing:** Control, society, professionalism, constraint
**Casual Clothing:** Authenticity, comfort, relatability, freedom
**Vintage Clothing:** Nostalgia, timelessness, artistic choice
**Futuristic Clothing:** Innovation, otherworldly, conceptual
**Minimal/Nude:** Vulnerability, purity, stripped to essence
**Layered:** Complexity, protection, hiding
**Flowing:** Freedom, movement, ethereal
**Tight/Structured:** Control, power, constraint

## Quick Wardrobe Decisions

**For isolation theme:** Muted single color, simple silhouette
**For power theme:** Bold colors, structured pieces, dramatic
**For vulnerability:** Soft fabrics, muted tones, simple
**For transformation:** Start constrained → end flowing
**For timelessness:** Classic cuts, avoid obvious trends

**In Sora prompts:** Be specific about color, fabric type, and silhouette. Wardrobe should support emotion, not distract.
