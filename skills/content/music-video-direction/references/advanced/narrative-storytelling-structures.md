# Narrative Storytelling Structures for Music Videos

## The Challenge of 3-Minute Stories

Unlike films, music videos have 3-4 minutes to tell a complete story. This requires different narrative techniques.

## Three-Act Structure (Compressed)

**Traditional film:** 30-120 minutes
**Music video:** 3-4 minutes

**Adapted structure:**

### Act 1: Setup (First 30-45 seconds)
- Introduce character/situation
- Establish the world
- Present the problem/desire

**Corresponding to:** Intro + Verse 1

### Act 2: Conflict/Development (Middle 90-120 seconds)
- Character pursues goal
- Obstacles appear
- Situation develops/complicates

**Corresponding to:** Chorus 1 + Verse 2 + Chorus 2

### Act 3: Resolution (Final 45-60 seconds)
- Climax
- Resolution (or intentional non-resolution)
- Final emotional state

**Corresponding to:** Bridge + Final Chorus + Outro

## Alternative Narrative Structures

### Linear Narrative
**What:** Events in chronological order
**When to use:** Clear storytelling, relatability
**Example:** Person's day from morning to night reflecting song's emotional arc

### Non-Linear Narrative
**What:** Events out of chronological order
**When to use:** Mystery, artistic approach, complex emotions
**Example:** Start at emotional climax, flashback to show how we got there

### Circular Narrative
**What:** End returns to beginning
**When to use:** Cyclical themes, futility, or triumph coming full circle
**Example:** Opens and closes on same image, journey in between

### Episodic Narrative
**What:** Series of connected moments, not continuous action
**When to use:** Sora-friendly! Each clip is distinct moment
**Example:** Relationship shown through disconnected key moments

### Parallel Narratives
**What:** Two stories happening simultaneously
**When to use:** Contrast, connection, before/after
**Example:** Two people in different locations, eventually meet

### Symbolic Narrative
**What:** Story is metaphor for emotion, not literal
**When to use:** Abstract emotions, conceptual approach
**Example:** Person climbing mountain = overcoming internal struggle

## Music Video-Specific Narrative Techniques

### 1. Emotional Arc Over Plot

**Focus on:** How character FEELS, not complex plot

**Structure:**
- Beginning emotional state
- Middle transformation
- End emotional state

**Example:**
- Start: Isolated, sad
- Middle: Attempting connection
- End: Connected, hopeful (or still isolated but accepting)

### 2. Verse/Chorus Narrative Split

**Verses:** Advance narrative
**Choruses:** Emotional reflection or parallel visual metaphor

**Example:**
- Verses: Literal story of breakup
- Choruses: Abstract visuals of breaking/shattering

### 3. Visual Motifs as Narrative

**Repeating visual element that evolves:**

**Example:**
- First appearance: Single wilted flower
- Second: Flower slightly more alive
- Third: Flower blooming
- Final: Field of flowers

Tells story through symbolic progression.

### 4. Character Transformation

**Simple arc:** Character physically or emotionally transforms

**Examples:**
- Costume/appearance changes showing growth
- Color entering grayscale world
- Person becoming more transparent/solid
- Aging or de-aging

### 5. The Journey Structure

**Simple but effective:** Character goes from A to B

**Physical journeys reflect emotional journeys:**
- Walking from darkness to light
- Climbing upward
- Moving through transforming environments
- Escaping confinement to freedom

## Narrative Beats for 3:30 Song

**:00-:15 - INTRO**
Establish: Who, where, what's the situation?

**:15-:45 - VERSE 1**
Develop: Character's desire or problem becomes clear

**:45-:55 - PRE-CHORUS**
Complication: Something changes or obstacle appears

**:55-1:20 - CHORUS 1**
Emotional peak: Character reacts, attempts solution, or we see metaphor

**1:20-1:50 - VERSE 2**
Development: Situation evolves, new information, attempt fails/succeeds

**1:50-2:00 - PRE-CHORUS**
Building: Tension increases

**2:00-2:25 - CHORUS 2**
Repeated emotion: Same feeling, deeper or different angle

**2:25-2:45 - BRIDGE**
Turning point: Everything changes, realization, breakdown, or breakthrough

**2:45-3:20 - FINAL CHORUS**
Resolution approach: Emotional climax

**3:20-3:30 - OUTRO**
Resolution: Where character ends up (or ambiguous ending)

## Character Development in Limited Time

**You can't do complex character development.**

**What you CAN do:**

### Simple Character Arc Types:

**1. Defeated → Empowered**
Visual: Starts small/hunched → Ends standing tall

**2. Isolated → Connected**
Visual: Starts alone → Ends with others/touching someone

**3. Trapped → Free**
Visual: Starts in confined space → Ends in open space

**4. Broken → Whole**
Visual: Starts fragmented → Ends unified

**5. Lost → Found**
Visual: Starts wandering → Ends at destination

**6. Numb → Feeling**
Visual: Starts in grayscale → Ends in color

## Narrative Clarity vs Ambiguity

**Spectrum:**
```
100% Clear ←――――――――――――→ 100% Ambiguous
(Anyone gets it)        (Personal interpretation)
```

**Where to land:**
- **Pop/Commercial:** 70% clear (broad appeal)
- **Indie/Art:** 40% clear (room for interpretation)
- **Experimental:** 20% clear (intentionally obscure)

**Test:** If 5 people watch and describe the story, do they all tell roughly the same story? (If yes = clear, if wildly different = ambiguous)

## Dialogue vs No Dialogue

**Music videos rarely use dialogue** (music is the dialogue)

**If using dialogue:**
- Very minimal (1-2 lines max)
- Non-verbal communication preferred (looks, gestures)
- Dialogue serves symbolic purpose, not plot exposition

**Sora consideration:**
- Lip-sync dialogue possible in prompts
- Keep it minimal (Sora better at atmosphere than conversation)

## Protagonist Types

### Single Character Focus
**Pros:** Clear identification, emotional connection
**Cons:** Needs strong presence, limits perspectives
**When:** Personal songs, character-driven stories

### Dual Character (Relationship)
**Pros:** Relationship dynamics, contrast
**Cons:** Both need definition in limited time
**When:** Love songs, conflict songs, connection themes

### Ensemble (Multiple Characters)
**Pros:** Varied perspectives, community feeling
**Cons:** Hard to develop individuals
**When:** Anthems, community themes

### No Human Character (Abstract/Symbolic)
**Pros:** Universal, open to interpretation, Sora-friendly
**Cons:** Less personal connection
**When:** Conceptual approach, abstract emotions

**Recommendation for Sora:** Single character or abstract (AI best at these)

## Narrative Pacing

**Music dictates pace, not narrative logic:**

**Fast song:** Quick narrative beats, rapid progression
**Slow song:** Lingering moments, fewer narrative events

**Don't fight the music.**

## Common Narrative Pitfalls

❌ **Too complex:** Trying to tell feature-film story in 3 minutes
✅ **Simple arc:** One clear emotional journey

❌ **Plot over emotion:** Focusing on what happens vs how they feel
✅ **Emotion over plot:** We care about feelings, not intricate plot

❌ **Unclear stakes:** Why should we care?
✅ **Clear stakes:** We understand what matters to character

❌ **No ending:** Story just stops
✅ **Ending:** Resolution, transformation, or intentional ambiguity

## Narrative Structures for Sora

**Best for AI generation:**

### Episodic Moments
Each clip is distinct moment in story
**Why:** No need for perfect continuity between clips

### Transformation Arc
Character/environment changes progressively
**Why:** Each clip shows different stage clearly

### Symbolic Journey
Abstract progression through spaces/states
**Why:** Continuity matters less, concept matters more

**Avoid for AI:**
- Complex continuous action
- Dialogue-heavy scenes
- Intricate cause-effect sequences

## Quick Narrative Exercises

**Exercise 1: Emotional States**
Pick 3 emotional states. Create visual for each.
- Beginning: [emotion] = [visual]
- Middle: [emotion] = [visual]
- End: [emotion] = [visual]

**Exercise 2: Object Journey**
Follow one object through transformations
- Broken → Repaired
- Lost → Found
- Buried → Unearthed

**Exercise 3: Environment Tells Story**
No characters, just spaces that suggest narrative
- Abandoned room → Someone was here
- Slowly filling with water → Disaster approaching
- Growing plants → Time passing, hope returning

## Ending Types

**Resolution:** Problem solved, character changed, clear ending
**Open:** Ambiguous, viewer interprets
**Circular:** Returns to beginning (has character changed?)
**Cliffhanger:** Story continues beyond video (risky - can frustrate)
**Symbolic:** Abstract ending representing emotional resolution

**Most music videos:** Resolution or Open ending

## Narrative Checklist

- [ ] Can I explain the story in one sentence?
- [ ] Is there a clear beginning, middle, end?
- [ ] Does character change or transform?
- [ ] Are the emotional stakes clear?
- [ ] Does narrative serve the song (not distract from it)?
- [ ] Is it simple enough for 3 minutes?
- [ ] Will viewers understand the core story?
- [ ] Does it work for Sora's strengths (if using AI)?

**Remember:** In music videos, emotion is the story. Plot is just the vehicle for delivering that emotion.
