# Performance Direction Techniques

## Working with Artists in Music Videos

Whether you're directing an artist's performance or creating silhouettes for Sora, understanding performance direction elevates your work.

## For Traditional Filming

### Pre-Performance Prep

**Build Comfort:**
- Warm up environment (music, conversation)
- Explain your vision clearly
- Show references
- Give permission to experiment

**Technical Setup:**
- Playback quality (artist needs to hear themselves)
- Monitoring (can they see themselves?)
- Timing marks (where to hit certain words)

### Direction Techniques

**Energy Levels:**
- "Give me 50% energy" (controlled)
- "Now 100%" (full performance)
- "Back to 70%" (sustainable)

**Authenticity:**
- "Forget the camera"
- "Sing to someone specific"
- "What does this lyric mean to you?"

**Variation:**
- "Same take, but sadder"
- "Now angry version"
- "Try it without moving"

### Common Performance Issues

**Problem:** Artist is stiff/uncomfortable
**Solution:** Start with movement exercises, play full song first, build confidence

**Problem:** Over-performing (too theatrical)
**Solution:** "Pull it back 30%", "More internal, less external"

**Problem:** Lip-sync timing off
**Solution:** Practice sections, use visual cues, slow-mo playback for checking

## For Sora/AI Workflow

### Describing Performance in Prompts

**Instead of directing humans, you're directing AI to create performance imagery:**

**Effective performance prompts:**
```
Close-up of silhouetted figure, head tilted back, mouth open in singing motion, passionate body language, arms extended, expressing raw emotion
```

**What works:**
- Silhouettes (avoid uncanny valley)
- Shadows
- Wide shots (less facial detail needed)
- Obscured faces (back-lit, masked, turned away)
- Strong poses over subtle acting

**What to avoid:**
- Detailed facial expressions (AI struggles)
- Nuanced lip-sync close-ups
- Complex emotional subtlety

### AI-Friendly Performance Concepts

**Static Powerful Poses:**
"Figure frozen mid-performance, captured at peak emotional moment"

**Silhouette Performance:**
"Backlit performer silhouette, dynamic pose against bright background"

**Shadow Performance:**
"Performer's shadow cast large on wall, shadow performs while figure stays still"

**Obscured Performance:**
"Performer behind frosted glass/water/veil, movement visible but face obscured"

## Choreography Considerations

### Simple Movements for Sora

**Works well:**
- Single arm raises
- Head tilts
- Body sways
- Turning/rotating
- Walking/basic steps

**Difficult:**
- Complex dance sequences
- Rapid movements
- Synchronized group choreography
- Acrobatics

**Strategy:** Break complex choreography into simple held poses

## Performance Energy by Genre

**Pop:** High energy, choreographed, polished, confident
**Rock:** Raw energy, authentic, less polished, intense
**R&B:** Smooth, controlled, sensual, vocal-focused
**Hip-Hop:** Confident, direct address, powerful presence
**Indie:** Understated, authentic, vulnerable, less performative

## Emotional Performance Direction

**Joy:** Open body, lifted chin, expansive movements
**Sadness:** Closed body, downward gaze, minimal movement
**Anger:** Tense body, aggressive movements, direct stare
**Vulnerability:** Protective gestures, soft movements, averted gaze
**Confidence:** Open stance, direct eye contact, controlled movements

## The "Less is More" Principle

**Often, subtle is stronger than theatrical:**
- Small gesture > Grand gesture
- Stillness > Constant movement
- Authentic emotion > Performed emotion

## Performance Checklist

- [ ] Does the energy level match the song section?
- [ ] Is the performance authentic to the artist's brand?
- [ ] Does movement enhance or distract from music?
- [ ] Is it sustainable for full video? (Not too exhausting)
- [ ] Does it work for Sora's capabilities? (If using AI)

**Use this knowledge** when describing performance in Sora prompts or when directing real artists. Performance should amplify the song, never distract from it.
