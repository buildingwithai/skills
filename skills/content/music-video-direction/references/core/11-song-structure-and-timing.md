# Song Structure and Timing

## Understanding Song Anatomy

Before you can create effective visuals, you must understand how songs are built. Music videos are slaves to song structure - your visuals must work with the music, not against it.

## Standard Song Sections

### INTRO
**Duration:** Typically 5-20 seconds
**Musical characteristics:** Instrumental, building, establishing tone
**Energy level:** Low to medium (building)

**Visual strategy:**
- Establish the world/concept
- Hook the viewer (first 5-10 seconds critical!)
- Set mood and tone
- Tease what's to come
- Can be minimalist (let music breathe)

**Common approaches:**
- Slow reveal of environment
- Artist introduction (but not always)
- Conceptual establishing shot
- Atmospheric mood-setting

**Sora considerations:**
- 1-2 clips typically (5-20 seconds = 1-2 ten-second clips)
- Use this time to establish your visual language
- Make the first clip GRAB attention

### VERSE
**Duration:** Typically 20-30 seconds
**Musical characteristics:** Storytelling, lower energy than chorus, lyrics-focused
**Energy level:** Medium (verses build toward chorus)

**Visual strategy:**
- Tell story or develop concept
- Lower visual intensity than chorus (save peak for chorus)
- Focus on narrative or conceptual development
- Longer shots, more breathing room
- Introduce or develop characters/themes

**V1 vs V2:**
- Verse 1: Introduce the situation/concept
- Verse 2: Develop, complicate, or add new layer
- Don't just repeat - evolve

**Sora considerations:**
- 2-3 clips per verse
- Slightly slower pacing than chorus
- Use for narrative progression

### PRE-CHORUS (Bridge to Chorus)
**Duration:** Typically 8-15 seconds
**Musical characteristics:** Building tension, transition, anticipation
**Energy level:** Rising (medium→high)

**Visual strategy:**
- Build visual tension toward chorus
- Increase cutting pace
- Camera movement accelerates
- Transition from verse mood to chorus mood
- Create anticipation

**Techniques:**
- Faster cuts
- Camera movement speeding up
- Color shift beginning
- Visual elements multiplying

**Sora considerations:**
- 1-2 clips
- Plan for energy escalation
- End on setup for chorus impact

### CHORUS
**Duration:** Typically 20-30 seconds
**Musical characteristics:** The hook, highest energy, most repeated section
**Energy level:** HIGH (peak of song)

**Visual strategy:**
- **MOST IMPORTANT VISUALS**
- Most memorable imagery goes here
- Peak visual impact
- Fast cutting OR powerful sustained shots
- This is what people will remember
- Must be strong enough to repeat 2-4 times with variation

**Chorus repetition strategy:**
- Chorus 1: Establish the iconic image/concept
- Chorus 2: Same concept, different angle or increased intensity
- Final Chorus: Biggest, most intense version

**Sora considerations:**
- 2-3 clips per chorus
- Plan variations across multiple choruses
- Highest visual energy

### BRIDGE
**Duration:** Typically 15-25 seconds
**Musical characteristics:** Change-up, often different musically, emotional shift
**Energy level:** Variable (can be breakdown, build, or different energy entirely)

**Visual strategy:**
- BREAK THE PATTERN
- Different from everything else in video
- Can be: stripped down, maximal, different location, different color, different camera approach
- Emotional or conceptual shift
- Surprise or deepen the concept

**Common bridge approaches:**
- Everything stops (minimalist moment)
- Everything explodes (maximalist)
- Location/setting change
- Color palette shift
- Time shift (flashback/flash-forward)
- Intimate closeup after wide shots
- Abstract/surreal after literal

**Sora considerations:**
- 1-3 clips depending on bridge length
- Plan something VISUALLY DIFFERENT
- This is your chance to surprise

### OUTRO (Ending)
**Duration:** Typically 10-30 seconds
**Musical characteristics:** Wind down, fade out, final statement
**Energy level:** Falling (medium→low)

**Visual strategy:**
- Resolution or final statement
- Leave lasting final image
- Can mirror intro (bookend structure)
- Give sense of completion or deliberate open-endedness

**Common approaches:**
- Return to opening image (circular)
- Fade to black/white
- Final wide shot pulling back
- Artist final pose/look
- Conceptual resolution

**Sora considerations:**
- 1-3 clips
- Final clip should feel like an ending
- Plan for fade or strong final frame

## Less Common Sections

### POST-CHORUS
**Duration:** 8-15 seconds
**Musical characteristics:** Instrumental or repeated hook after chorus
**Energy level:** Medium-high (sustaining chorus energy)

**Visual strategy:**
- Sustain chorus energy
- Can be instrumental/atmospheric
- Bridge between chorus and next verse

### BREAKDOWN
**Duration:** 8-20 seconds
**Musical characteristics:** Stripped-down section, often minimal instrumentation
**Energy level:** Low (intentional energy drop)

**Visual strategy:**
- Minimal visuals matching minimal music
- Intimate moments
- Breath before build

### BUILD-UP
**Duration:** 8-15 seconds
**Musical characteristics:** Tension building (common in EDM)
**Energy level:** Rising dramatically

**Visual strategy:**
- Rapid escalation
- Faster cuts
- Visual elements intensifying
- Create anticipation for drop

### DROP (EDM/Electronic)
**Duration:** Moment of peak
**Musical characteristics:** Payoff after build-up, maximum energy
**Energy level:** MAXIMUM

**Visual strategy:**
- Biggest visual payoff
- Flash, explosion, transformation
- Visual climax

## Mapping Your Song

### Step 1: Listen and Mark Sections

Listen to your song with a timer and note:

```
0:00-0:12  Intro
0:12-0:32  Verse 1
0:32-0:42  Pre-Chorus
0:42-1:02  Chorus 1
1:02-1:22  Verse 2
1:22-1:32  Pre-Chorus
1:32-1:52  Chorus 2
1:52-2:12  Bridge
2:12-2:32  Chorus 3 (Final)
2:32-2:45  Outro
```

### Step 2: Calculate Clip Needs

Divide each section by 10 seconds:

```
Intro (12s) = 2 clips
Verse 1 (20s) = 2 clips
Pre-Chorus (10s) = 1 clip
Chorus 1 (20s) = 2 clips
... etc.

Total: ~18 clips for this example song
```

### Step 3: Assign Energy Levels

Rate each section 1-10 for visual energy:

```
Intro: 3 (building)
Verse 1: 5 (medium)
Pre-Chorus: 7 (rising)
Chorus 1: 9 (high)
Verse 2: 6 (slightly higher than V1)
Pre-Chorus: 8 (rising)
Chorus 2: 9 (high, matching C1)
Bridge: 4 (breakdown) or 10 (explosion) - depends on song
Final Chorus: 10 (maximum)
Outro: 4 (wind down)
```

Your visual intensity should track this.

## BPM and Visual Timing

### What is BPM?

**BPM = Beats Per Minute**

The tempo of the song affects visual pacing.

### BPM Ranges and Visual Strategies

**60-80 BPM (Slow Ballads)**
- One beat every ~1 second
- Visual approach: Slow, lingering shots
- Cut frequency: Every 2-3 seconds or longer
- Camera movement: Slow, deliberate
- Sora clips: Fewer actions per clip, emphasize stillness

**80-100 BPM (Mid-Tempo)**
- One beat every ~0.75 seconds
- Visual approach: Moderate pacing
- Cut frequency: Every 1-2 seconds
- Camera movement: Balanced
- Sora clips: Standard 4-beat structure works well

**100-120 BPM (Upbeat Pop/Rock)**
- One beat every ~0.6 seconds
- Visual approach: Energetic
- Cut frequency: Every 1-1.5 seconds
- Camera movement: Dynamic
- Sora clips: More action, faster progressions

**120-140 BPM (Dance/Energetic)**
- One beat every ~0.5 seconds
- Visual approach: Fast, dynamic
- Cut frequency: Every 0.5-1 second
- Camera movement: Quick
- Sora clips: Rapid developments, plan more clips

**140+ BPM (Hardcore/Drum & Bass)**
- One beat every ~0.4 seconds
- Visual approach: Frenetic
- Cut frequency: Very fast, on every beat
- Camera movement: Rapid or extreme stability (contrast)
- Sora clips: Maximum clips, minimal per-clip action

### Syncing Visual Beats to Musical Beats

**On-the-beat cutting:**
Cuts happen exactly on musical beats

**Example at 90 BPM:**
- Beat occurs every ~0.67 seconds
- Cut every 2 beats = cut every ~1.33 seconds
- Cut every 4 beats = cut every ~2.67 seconds

**In Sora prompts:**
Time your action beats to land on musical beats:
```
At 0:00: [on downbeat]
At 0:67: [on next beat]
At 1:33: [on beat]
... etc
```

**Practical approach:**
Don't perfectly calculate - listen and FEEL where beats land, then time actions to those moments.

## Energy Mapping Exercise

Create a visual energy map:

```
Energy
  10|                                    ████
   9|                        ████        ████
   8|            ████        ████        ████
   7|            ████   ████ ████   ████ ████
   6|       ████ ████   ████ ████   ████ ████
   5|  ████ ████ ████   ████ ████   ████ ████
   4|  ████ ████ ████   ████ ████   ████ ████
   3|  ████ ████ ████   ████ ████   ████ ████
   2|████ ████ ████ ████ ████ ████ ████ ████
   1|____________________________________
      In  V1  PC  C1   V2  PC  C2  Br   FC Out
```

Your visual energy should mirror this musical energy.

## Repetition with Variation

### The Chorus Problem

Chorus repeats 2-4 times. How to keep it interesting?

**Strategy: Same Core Concept, Different Execution**

**Example concept:** Person breaking through glass

**Chorus 1:**
- Medium shot, person pushing against invisible glass
- First cracks appear
- Moderate intensity

**Chorus 2:**
- Wider shot showing full glass barrier
- More cracks, more aggressive pushing
- Higher intensity, same concept

**Final Chorus:**
- Multiple angles: close-ups of cracks spreading, wide shot of full barrier
- Glass shatters completely
- Maximum intensity, payoff of concept

**Variables to change:**
- Camera angle
- Shot size (CU → MS → WS)
- Number of elements
- Speed/intensity
- Color intensity
- Time of day
- Weather
- Location variation

### The Verse Problem

Verse 1 and Verse 2 have same melody, different lyrics.

**Strategy: Visual Development**

**Verse 1:**
- Introduce the situation
- Establish character/concept
- Set baseline

**Verse 2:**
- Show development/consequence
- Add complication
- Raise stakes or deepen emotion
- Same visual world, evolved

**Example:**
- V1: Person walking through empty city
- V2: Same city walk, but now shadows follow them (development)

## Timing Precision for Sora

### Lyric Sync

When specific lyrics need to sync with visuals:

**Step 1:** Note exact timestamp of lyric
Example: "break free" lyric hits at 1:23.5

**Step 2:** Determine which clip that falls in
If clip 14 runs from 1:20-1:30, lyric is at 0:03.5 of that clip

**Step 3:** Time visual action to lyric
```
At 0:03: chains shatter and fall away, synchronized with "break free" lyric
```

### Musical Moment Sync

**Drum hits, bass drops, cymbal crashes - sync visuals:**

Example: Big drum hit at 2:05

```
At 0:05 of that clip: sharp visual punctuation - flash, cut, slam, explosion
```

## Pacing Strategies

### Even Pacing
Similar shot duration throughout
**When:** Hypnotic effect, trance-like, consistent mood

### Accelerating Pacing
Shots get shorter/faster as song progresses
**When:** Building tension, escalation

### Wave Pacing
Faster during chorus, slower during verse
**When:** Most songs (follows natural energy)

### Contrast Pacing
Very slow shots interrupted by very fast bursts
**When:** Dramatic effect, surprise

## Shot Duration Guidelines

### By Song Energy

**Low energy sections:**
- Shot duration: 2-4 seconds
- Let moments breathe
- Contemplative

**Medium energy sections:**
- Shot duration: 1-2 seconds
- Standard pacing
- Balanced

**High energy sections:**
- Shot duration: 0.5-1 second
- Fast cutting
- Energetic, dynamic

### By Emotion

**Sad/Melancholy:**
- Longer shots (3-5 seconds)
- Let emotion sink in
- Patient

**Happy/Joyful:**
- Faster cuts (1-2 seconds)
- Energy and movement
- Dynamic

**Tense/Anxious:**
- Variable (create unease)
- Unpredictable rhythm
- Unsettling

## Building Across the Full Song

### Arc Structures

**Linear Escalation:**
Start low → build to maximum → end high
```
Energy: Low ————→ ————→ ————→ HIGH
        Intro    V/C      Bridge Final
```

**Wave Structure:**
Low → High → Low → Higher → Highest
```
Energy: Low→High→Low→High→PEAK
        In V1 C1 V2 C2  Br FC
```

**Bookend Structure:**
Start same as end, journey in between
```
Same→Different→Journey→Return→Same
Intro             exploring      Outro
```

**Surprise Structure:**
Build expectation then subvert
```
Expected→Expected→BREAK→New
Standard sections   Bridge   New approach
```

## Common Timing Mistakes

❌ **Ignoring song structure** - Visuals that don't respect verse/chorus
✅ **Map to structure** - Distinct visual approach for each section

❌ **Same energy throughout** - Monotonous
✅ **Energy variation** - Tracks song's emotional arc

❌ **Fighting the tempo** - Slow visuals on fast song
✅ **Match tempo** - Pacing reflects BPM

❌ **Missing key moments** - Not syncing to important beats/lyrics
✅ **Sync critical moments** - Visual punctuation on musical punctuation

❌ **Repetition without variation** - Same chorus visuals 3 times
✅ **Variation** - Same concept, evolved execution

## Practical Exercise: Structure Your Song

Use this template:

```
SONG: [Title]
DURATION: [mm:ss]
BPM: [number]

SECTION BREAKDOWN:
Section    Start-End   Duration   Energy (1-10)   Visual Strategy
Intro      0:00-0:15   15s        3               [Your approach]
Verse 1    0:15-0:35   20s        5               [Your approach]
...

TOTAL CLIPS NEEDED: [Count based on duration]

ENERGY MAP: [Draw or describe energy flow]

KEY SYNC MOMENTS:
- [Timestamp]: [Musical moment] → [Visual response]
- [Timestamp]: [Lyric moment] → [Visual response]
```
