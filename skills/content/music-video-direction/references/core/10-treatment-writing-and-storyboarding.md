# Treatment Writing and Storyboarding

## What is a Music Video Treatment?

A treatment is a visual pitch document that sells your creative vision for a music video to the artist, label, or client. It's part sales document, part creative blueprint.

**Purpose:**
- Win the job (pitch document)
- Communicate your vision clearly
- Get everyone aligned before production
- Serve as production roadmap once approved

## Treatment vs Storyboard

**Treatment:** Written + visual document describing the concept
**Storyboard:** Visual shot-by-shot drawings/images showing every scene

For AI/Sora workflow:
- **Treatment:** Sell the concept, get buy-in
- **Storyboard:** Your Sora prompt collection IS your storyboard

## The Music Video Treatment Structure

### Music Video treatments are different from film treatments:

**Film treatment:** Detailed, wordy, plot-focused
**Music video treatment:** Visual-first, punchy, mood-focused

**Rule:** Less text, more images. Artists and labels want to FEEL it, not read it.

## Essential Treatment Components

### 1. Header/Title Page

**Include:**
- Song title
- Artist name
- Your name (director)
- Date
- Contact info

**Example:**
```
"SONG TITLE"
Artist Name
Music Video Treatment

Directed by: Your Name
Date: [Date]
Contact: email@example.com
```

Keep it simple and professional.

### 2. Concept Overview (1-2 Paragraphs MAX)

**The Big Idea:** What is this video about in one compelling paragraph?

**What to include:**
- Core concept in 2-3 sentences
- Why this concept serves the song
- The emotional experience for viewers
- Any unique/standout elements

**What to avoid:**
- Technical jargon
- Overly detailed descriptions
- More than 2 short paragraphs
- Explaining your reasoning too much

**Example:**
```
CONCEPT

A solitary figure sits on a wooden stool in the middle of an endless ocean, singing into a vintage microphone whose cord disappears into the water below. This impossible scenario visualizes the isolation and vulnerability at the heart of the song—surrounded by vastness but completely alone, voice carried across empty water.

As the song builds, the ocean transforms: calm waters during verses become increasingly turbulent during choruses, yet the singer remains, anchored to their stool, committed to being heard despite the impossibility of the situation.
```

### 3. Visual Approach (Bullets or Short Sections)

**What it looks like:** Describe the visual style clearly

**Include:**
- Camera style (static, handheld, cinematic, etc.)
- Color palette (be specific)
- Locations/settings
- Overall aesthetic (dreamy, gritty, surreal, polished, etc.)

**Format as bullets for scannability:**

**Example:**
```
VISUAL APPROACH

• Surreal conceptual imagery – impossible scenarios presented as normal
• Desaturated blue-gray and purple color palette creating melancholic atmosphere
• Mix of wide establishing shots emphasizing isolation and intimate close-ups showing emotion
• Calm, deliberate camera movements – slow cranes, gentle orbits, patient stillness
• Ocean as primary setting, shifting from glass-calm to turbulent reflecting emotional journey
• Vintage aesthetic elements (microphone, stool) grounding surreal in tangible objects
```

### 4. Scene Breakdown (By Song Section)

**Map concept to song structure:**

Format:
```
[SECTION] (timestamp)
Brief description of what happens visually
```

**Example:**
```
INTRO (0:00-0:15)
Fade in on vast empty ocean at dusk. Slow crane shot reveals tiny figure on stool in center of frame. Water perfectly still, creating mirror reflection. Establish the impossible scenario.

VERSE 1 (0:15-0:45)
Medium shots of singer on stool, vintage microphone, singing calmly. Microphone cord visible entering water. Slow orbit around subject. Ocean remains calm. Intimacy and vulnerability.

PRE-CHORUS (0:45-0:55)
Water begins subtle rippling. Camera pushes closer. Building tension.

CHORUS (0:55-1:20)
Wide shots showing scale of ocean. Waves building around stool but person remains steady. Intercutting between wide (isolation) and close-up (determination). Water more active, reflecting emotional intensity.

VERSE 2 (1:20-1:50)
Return to calmer water but mood has shifted. Slightly different camera angles on same scenario, showing passage of time. Focus on details – hands on microphone, feet on stool rungs underwater.

```

**Keep each section to 2-3 sentences max.**

### 5. Visual References / Mood Board

**This is critical for music video treatments.**

**Include 5-15 reference images:**
- Overall mood/vibe references
- Color palette examples
- Specific shot composition references
- Lighting examples
- Similar video references (careful - don't just copy)

**How to present:**
- Grid layout of images
- Each image can have brief caption
- Mix of film stills, photography, other music videos, art

**Example caption format:**
- "Color palette reference – desaturated blues"
- "Camera angle inspiration – low perspective on water"
- "Mood reference – isolation and vastness"

**Where to find references:**
- Film stills from cinematography-focused sites
- Photography (search specific terms like "ocean solitude photography")
- Other music videos (but make clear you're showing mood, not copying concept)
- Art (paintings, installations)

### 6. Artist's Role (If Applicable)

**What will the artist be doing?**

Be clear and realistic:

**Example:**
```
ARTIST PERFORMANCE

The artist will be the sole on-camera talent, performing the song seated on the stool throughout. Performance is calm and intimate rather than energetic – focused singing, subtle movements, direct connection with camera during key lyric moments.

No choreography or dance elements. Emphasis on vulnerability and authentic vocal performance. Multiple wardrobe options discussed below, but minimal costume changes (maximum 2 looks to differentiate verse and chorus if desired).
```

### 7. Production Notes (Optional but Helpful)

**Brief notes on feasibility:**
- Locations needed (or "All AI-generated")
- Special requirements
- Timeline estimate
- Any challenges to address

**For Sora/AI workflow:**
```
PRODUCTION APPROACH

This concept will be executed entirely through AI video generation (Sora), allowing for impossible scenarios that would be impractical or impossible to film practically. The surreal ocean setting, seamless 360-degree shots, and environmental transformations are all achievable through detailed prompt engineering.

Estimated timeline: 2-3 weeks for concept refinement and prompt development, 1 week for generation and editing.
```

## Treatment Writing Principles

### Principle 1: Visual Over Verbal

**Bad:** "The artist feels isolated and this is shown through various visual techniques that emphasize their solitude in a way that makes the viewer understand their emotional state."

**Good:** "A single figure. Endless ocean. No land in sight."

**Why:** Clients respond to visuals they can imagine, not explanations.

### Principle 2: Confidence Not Apologetics

**Bad:** "I think maybe we could try showing the ocean, or possibly another setting if you prefer, whatever works best..."

**Good:** "The ocean setting creates the visceral isolation the song demands."

**Why:** You're the director. Own your vision.

### Principle 3: Show Don't Tell Emotion

**Bad:** "This video will be very emotional and make people feel sad."

**Good:** "Desaturated colors. Slow, patient camera. A person singing to an empty horizon."

**Why:** The visuals create emotion; you don't need to say "this is emotional."

### Principle 4: Specific Not Generic

**Bad:** "Cool colors and interesting camera angles"

**Good:** "Teal and gray color palette. Low angles emphasizing vast sky above solitary figure."

**Why:** Specificity shows you've thought it through.

### Principle 5: Connect to Song

**Every section should implicitly or explicitly connect to the song's themes:**

**Example:**
"The impossible scenario of the ocean stool mirrors the song's lyric 'I'm here but I'm not here' – present but disconnected, grounded but adrift."

## Treatment Length

**Ideal length: 2-4 pages**

**Breakdown:**
- Page 1: Title, Concept (1-2 paragraphs)
- Page 2: Visual Approach, Scene Breakdown (first half)
- Page 3: Scene Breakdown (second half), Production Notes
- Page 4+: Visual References (images)

**Too short:** Under 2 pages feels underdeveloped
**Too long:** Over 6 pages won't get read

**Exception:** Major budget productions might want more detail, but keep core treatment short and add appendices.

## Visual Reference Best Practices

### Quality Over Quantity
5 perfect references > 20 mediocre ones

### Diverse Types
Mix stills, photography, art, existing videos

### Annotate
Brief captions explaining WHY you've included each image

### Copyright Awareness
These are references/inspiration, not final assets
Always note "Reference only - not for final use"

### Organization
Group by category:
- Mood/Atmosphere
- Color Palette
- Cinematography/Shots
- Setting/Location Inspiration

## Tailoring to Your Audience

### For Independent Artists (Direct to Artist)
- More creative freedom
- Can be more experimental
- Focus on emotional connection and artistic vision
- Budget consciousness appreciated

### For Labels (Music Industry)
- Professional presentation
- Align with artist brand
- Show understanding of target audience
- Include commercial viability notes
- Timeline and budget awareness

### For Sora/AI Workflow Clients
- Emphasize what's possible with AI that isn't with traditional filming
- Address concerns about AI look/quality
- Show technical knowledge
- Explain creative advantages (impossible scenarios, cost, speed)

## Presenting the Treatment

### Written Presentation
- PDF format (professional, consistent across devices)
- Good typography (readable, not fancy)
- High-quality reference images
- No spelling/grammar errors

### In-Person Pitch
- Walk through treatment, don't just read it
- Show passion for concept
- Be open to feedback and collaboration
- Have backup ideas for concerns

### Virtual Presentation
- Screen share through PDF
- Verbal walk-through
- Pause for reactions and questions
- Follow up with emailed PDF

## Handling Feedback and Revisions

### Common Feedback and How to Respond

**"I love it but can we make it less [abstract/dark/weird]?"**
→ Show how you can simplify while keeping core concept
→ Offer scaled-back version
→ Identify the 20% that delivers 80% of impact

**"This doesn't feel like me/my brand"**
→ Ask for references of videos they connect with
→ Revise with their brand in mind
→ Find middle ground between your vision and their identity

**"This seems expensive/complicated"**
→ Explain Sora/AI advantage (if applicable)
→ Offer phased approach (core concept + optional elements)
→ Identify must-haves vs nice-to-haves

**"I don't understand the concept"**
→ Simplify explanation
→ Add more visual references
→ Walk through scene-by-scene verbally

### Red Flags to Push Back On

**"Can you make it look exactly like [famous video]?"**
→ Explain inspired-by vs copying
→ Offer homage while maintaining originality

**"Can you add [random unrelated element]?"**
→ Discuss how it serves (or doesn't serve) the song
→ Offer integrated alternative if possible

**"We want to be involved in every decision"**
→ Set boundaries while staying collaborative
→ Clarify decision-making process upfront

## From Treatment to Production (Sora Workflow)

Once treatment is approved:

1. **Expand scene breakdown** → Detailed shot list
2. **Shot list** → Individual Sora prompts
3. **Use `templates/lyrics-mapping-template.md`** to organize
4. **Use `templates/sora-prompt-template.md`** for each clip
5. **Generate, review, iterate** with client if needed

The treatment becomes your north star - always refer back to ensure final video matches approved vision.

---

**Next:** Use this framework to create your treatment, then move to `templates/sora-prompt-template.md` to translate approved treatment into detailed Sora prompts.

**Remember:** A treatment sells a feeling. Make them FEEL your vision before you ever generate a frame.
