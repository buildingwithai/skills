# Genre-Specific Visual Conventions

## Why Genre Matters

Music genres have established visual languages that audiences expect. Understanding these conventions allows you to:

- **Follow them** for immediate genre recognition and audience comfort
- **Subvert them** intentionally for creative impact and differentiation
- **Blend them** for genre-fusion artists
- **Ignore them** when the song itself breaks genre boundaries

## Hip-Hop Music Videos

## Genre-Blending Strategies

When artist doesn't fit one genre:

**Identify Primary + Secondary:**
- Example: Alt-R&B = R&B conventions (70%) + Alternative/Indie approach (30%)
- Take primary genre lighting/color, secondary genre camera/editing

**Find Visual Middle Ground:**
- Hip-hop + Rock = Urban grit, dark colors, energetic performance
- Pop + Electronic = Bright colors, abstract environments, fast cuts
- Country + Pop = Natural settings, polished production, narrative + performance

**Intentional Contrast:**
- Use visual conventions from one genre on song from another
- Creates cognitive dissonance that can be powerful
- Example: Country song with EDM abstract visuals

## Quick Reference: Genre Decision Tree

**Song has strong narrative lyrics:**
→ Country or Rock narrative conventions

**Song is about partying/nightlife:**
→ Hip-Hop or EDM or Pop conventions

**Song is romantic/intimate:**
→ R&B conventions

**Song is high-energy, danceable:**
→ Pop or EDM conventions

**Song is raw, emotional, guitar-driven:**
→ Rock or Indie conventions

**Song showcases wealth/success themes:**
→ Hip-Hop conventions

**Song is experimental/artistic:**
→ Indie or Electronic (ambient) conventions

**Artist identity is more important than genre:**
→ Create signature style pulling from multiple genres

## The Subversion Formula

To intentionally subvert genre conventions:

1. **List expected conventions** for the genre
2. **Choose 2-3 to flip** (not all - becomes disconnected)
3. **Keep 2-3 conventions** (maintains genre connection)
4. **Make subversion purposeful** (serves song meaning)

**Example: Subverting Pop Conventions**
- Expected: Bright colors, fast cuts, choreography, upbeat
- Keep: Bright colors (1), artist central (2)
- Flip: Slow editing (1), no choreography/stillness (2), melancholic mood (3)
- Result: Still recognizably pop artist, but visually distinctive and emotionally resonant
