# 10-Second Scene Structure for Sora

## Understanding the 10-Second Constraint

Sora's current limitation is actually a creative opportunity. Understanding how to maximize these 10 seconds is critical for music video creation.

## What Can Actually Happen in 10 Seconds?

### The Reality Check

**10 seconds is:**
- 10 heartbeats at rest
- 2-3 breaths
- 3-4 steps when walking
- 1-2 sentences spoken
- 150-300 frames at 24fps

**10 seconds is NOT enough for:**
- Complex conversations
- Elaborate action sequences
- Multiple location changes
- Detailed narrative plot points
- Complex choreography

**10 seconds IS enough for:**
- One clear emotional beat
- One significant action
- One transformation
- One reveal
- One establishing moment

## The 4-Beat Structure

Break every 10-second clip into 4 micro-beats:

```
0:00-0:02 → ESTABLISH (What are we looking at?)
0:03-0:05 → DEVELOP (What changes or develops?)
0:06-0:08 → PEAK (What's the key moment?)
0:09-0:10 → RESOLVE/SETUP (How does it end or lead to next?)
```

### Beat 1: ESTABLISH (0:00-0:02)

**Purpose:** Orient the viewer

**What happens:**
- Camera/framing is established
- Subject/setting is visible
- Initial state is clear

**Prompting strategy:**
- "At 0:00: [initial static state or beginning of movement]"

**Examples:**
- "At 0:00: woman stands motionless in doorway, looking out"
- "At 0:00: camera reveals empty white room"
- "At 0:00: close-up of hand resting on surface"

**Common mistakes:**
- Starting mid-action (disorienting)
- Too much happening immediately

### Beat 2: DEVELOP (0:03-0:05)

**Purpose:** Introduce change or movement

**What happens:**
- Something begins to shift
- Movement initiates
- Emotion starts to show
- Camera movement begins

**Prompting strategy:**
- "At 0:03: [first development or change]"

**Examples:**
- "At 0:03: woman slowly raises hand to touch doorframe"
- "At 0:03: flowers begin sprouting from floor"
- "At 0:03: hand slowly curls into fist"

**Common mistakes:**
- Change is too subtle (nothing seems different)
- Change is too extreme (jarring jump)

### Beat 3: PEAK (0:06-0:08)

**Purpose:** The key moment of the clip

**What happens:**
- The main action or emotion
- The visual climax
- The memorable moment
- Peak intensity

**Prompting strategy:**
- "At 0:06: [peak action or emotional moment]"

**Examples:**
- "At 0:06: woman steps through doorway into blinding light"
- "At 0:06: room now filled waist-high with blooming flowers"
- "At 0:06: fist slams down, camera shakes slightly"

**Common mistakes:**
- Peak happens too early (clip deflates)
- Peak is unclear (what was the moment?)
- Multiple peaks (dilutes impact)

### Beat 4: RESOLVE/SETUP (0:09-0:10)

**Purpose:** End the clip or prepare for next

**What happens:**
- Settle into final state
- Preview next clip
- Leave on strong final image
- Create anticipation

**Prompting strategy:**
- "At 0:09: [conclusion or transition moment]"

**Examples:**
- "At 0:09: woman fully emerged in new space, turns to camera"
- "At 0:09: camera tilts up to show flower-filled ceiling"
- "At 0:09: hand opens, object falls away"

**Common mistakes:**
- Ending abruptly with no resolution
- Continuing action that will be cut (feels incomplete)

## Alternative 3-Beat Structure (Simpler)

For less complex clips:

```
0:00-0:03 → START (Opening state)
0:04-0:07 → TURN (The change)
0:08-0:10 → END (Final state)
```

**When to use:**
- Simpler concepts
- Atmospheric/environmental clips
- Establishing shots
- Transitions

**Example:**
- 0:00-0:03: Empty beach at sunset
- 0:04-0:07: Single figure walks into frame
- 0:08-0:10: Figure sits on sand, looking at ocean

## Scene Pacing Strategies

### SLOW PACING (Ballads, Emotional Moments)
- Minimal action
- Longer holds on states
- Subtle developments
- Emphasis on mood

**Example beat breakdown:**
- 0:00-0:04: Person sitting, barely moving
- 0:05-0:07: Slow head turn toward camera
- 0:08-0:10: Eyes close, single tear

### MEDIUM PACING (Most Music Videos)
- Balanced action
- Clear developments at each beat
- Visible but not frantic change

**Example beat breakdown:**
- 0:00: Person standing
- 0:03: Takes first step forward
- 0:06: Arms extend outward
- 0:09: Fully open pose, triumphant

### FAST PACING (High-Energy, EDM, Punk)
- Rapid changes
- Multiple micro-actions
- High intensity

**Example beat breakdown:**
- 0:00: Person still
- 0:02: Jump into air
- 0:05: Spin mid-air
- 0:07: Land in different pose
- 0:09: Freeze frame

**Note:** Even fast pacing in Sora should have clear beats, not chaos.

## Matching Clip Structure to Song BPM

**Slow BPM (60-80):**
- Use 3-beat structure
- Longer holds
- Slower camera movements
- Fewer actions per clip

**Medium BPM (80-120):**
- Use 4-beat structure
- Moderate pacing
- Balanced movement
- Standard approach

**Fast BPM (120+):**
- Can use 5-6 micro-beats if needed
- Quick developments
- Faster camera moves
- More cuts overall (more clips)

## Action Complexity Limits

### SIMPLE ACTION (Best for Sora)
**One primary action:**
- Person walks forward
- Object rotates
- Light intensifies
- Camera pans

**Success rate:** High
**Predictability:** Good

### MODERATE ACTION (Workable)
**Two connected actions:**
- Person walks forward AND raises arms
- Object rotates AND changes color
- Light intensifies AND camera pans

**Success rate:** Moderate
**Predictability:** Fair

### COMPLEX ACTION (Risky)
**Three+ actions:**
- Person walks, jumps, spins, lands
- Multiple objects moving independently
- Rapid transformations

**Success rate:** Low
**Predictability:** Poor

**Rule of thumb:** One clear action arc per clip.

## Continuity Between Clips

### The Cut Problem

You're generating clips separately. How do you ensure they flow?

**Strategy 1: End-State to Start-State Matching**

Clip 1 ending: "At 0:09: hand reaches for doorknob"
Clip 2 starting: "At 0:00: close-up of hand gripping doorknob"

**Strategy 2: Match Cuts**

Clip 1 ending: "At 0:09: camera pushes into person's eye, filling frame"
Clip 2 starting: "At 0:00: match cut from eye to tunnel opening, camera pulling back"

**Strategy 3: Environmental Continuity**

Keep consistent across clips:
- Same color palette description
- Same lighting setup
- Same time of day
- Same weather

**Strategy 4: Accept the Cuts**

Design for intentional cuts rather than smooth flow:
- Make each clip self-contained
- Use cuts as rhythm
- Match cuts to musical beats

## Emotional Arc Within 10 Seconds

Even short clips can have emotional progression:

### From Calm → Intense
- 0:00: Peaceful expression
- 0:03: Slight tension appears
- 0:06: Building intensity
- 0:09: Peak emotion

### From Sad → Hopeful
- 0:00: Looking down, withdrawn
- 0:03: Slight lift of head
- 0:06: Eyes find something off-camera
- 0:09: Small smile, hope emerges

### From Confusion → Clarity
- 0:00: Lost, disoriented
- 0:03: Searching, looking around
- 0:06: Spot something (realization)
- 0:09: Understanding, clarity

## Camera Movement Within 10 Seconds

### SLOW MOVEMENTS (Work Well)
- Gentle push in over 10 seconds
- Subtle orbit (30-45 degrees)
- Slow tilt or pan
- Gradual crane up/down

**Example timing:**
"Slow dolly push in from medium shot to close-up over full duration"

### FAST MOVEMENTS (Risky)
- Whip pans
- Rapid zooms
- Quick orbits (180-360 degrees)
- Shake/handheld with lots of movement

**If using fast movement:**
- Keep subject movement minimal
- One dynamic element at a time

## Environmental Changes Within 10 Seconds

What environmental transformations work in 10 seconds?

### WORKS WELL:
- Lighting change (dark → light or vice versa)
- Single element appearing (flowers sprouting, rain starting)
- Color shift (monochrome → color)
- Weather change beginning (clouds forming, sun breaking)
- Simple transformation (ice melting, object dissolving)

### DOESN'T WORK:
- Complete location change (city → forest)
- Multiple simultaneous transformations
- Complex physics (explosions, complex destruction)
- Elaborate VFX sequences

## The "One Thing" Rule

**Every 10-second clip should have ONE clear thing:**

✅ "This is the clip where they break through the glass"
✅ "This is the clip where the room fills with water"
✅ "This is the clip where they finally look at camera"

❌ "This is the clip where they break glass, water fills room, they look at camera, and also dance"

**If you can't summarize the clip in one sentence, it's too complex.**

## Building Across Multiple Clips

### The Escalation Pattern

For a 3:30 song (~21 clips), plan escalation:

**Clips 1-5 (Intro/V1):** Establish baseline
**Clips 6-10 (Chorus 1):** First intensification
**Clips 11-15 (V2/Chorus 2):** Further intensification
**Clips 16-18 (Bridge):** Change-up or peak
**Clips 19-21 (Final Chorus):** Maximum intensity

Each individual clip follows 4-beat structure, but clips collectively escalate.

### The Repetition Pattern

For chorus repetition across clips:

**Chorus 1 (Clips 6-8):**
Same core visual concept, establishing version

**Chorus 2 (Clips 12-14):**
Same concept, different angle or intensity

**Final Chorus (Clips 19-21):**
Same concept, maximum version

Each clip has same structure but intensifies overall.

## Timing Sync with Lyrics

### When Lyric Starts Mid-Clip

If lyric moment happens at 0:05 in your clip:

"At 0:05: [action synced to lyric moment]"

**Example:**
Lyric "break free" hits at 0:05 in timeline
Prompt: "At 0:05: chains shatter and fall away, synchronized with lyric"

### When Clip Covers Multiple Lyric Lines

Map actions to specific words:

- 0:00-0:03: First lyric phrase → Action 1
- 0:04-0:06: Second lyric phrase → Action 2
- 0:07-0:10: Third lyric phrase → Action 3

## Testing Your Scene Structure

Before finalizing prompts, ask:

**Clarity Test:**
- [ ] Can I describe what happens in one sentence?
- [ ] Is the action simple enough to execute in 10 seconds?

**Flow Test:**
- [ ] Does 0:00 establish clearly?
- [ ] Does something change by 0:03?
- [ ] Is there a peak moment at 0:06?
- [ ] Does 0:09 resolve or set up next clip?

**Pacing Test:**
- [ ] Does the pace match the song's energy at this moment?
- [ ] Are there moments of stillness (if needed)?

**Continuity Test:**
- [ ] How will this connect to the previous clip?
- [ ] How will this lead into the next clip?

## Common 10-Second Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Too Much Plot**
Trying to tell a complex story in one clip.
**Fix:** Focus on one emotional beat, not plot.

**Mistake 2: Static Boredom**
Nothing happens, no development.
**Fix:** Ensure clear change from 0:00 to 0:09.

**Mistake 3: Unclear Peak**
No obvious "key moment."
**Fix:** Make 0:06 beat your focal point.

**Mistake 4: Abrupt Ending**
Clip cuts mid-action uncomfortably.
**Fix:** Plan resolve at 0:09, not 0:12.

**Mistake 5: Ignoring Music**
Clip timing doesn't relate to song.
**Fix:** Sync at least one beat to musical moment.

**Next:** Apply this structure in `05-sora-prompt-engineering-framework.md` when writing time-stamped prompts, and use `templates/sora-prompt-template.md` to organize your timing.

**Remember:** 10 seconds is short, but it's enough for one powerful, clear moment. Embrace the constraint.
