## EXAMPLE 1: "Cannot Take Feedback" (10 seconds)
**Type:** Dialogue + Reaction
**Structure:** The Awkward Statement
**Characters:** Jovanny, Wei
**Scenario:** Jovanny asks for feedback, immediately gets defensive when he receives it

### Sora 2 Prompt

```
[CLIP DURATION: 10 seconds]

SEGMENT 1 (0-5 seconds):
- Camera: Handheld mockumentary style, medium two-shot, slightly unstable
- Scene: Modern startup office, conference room, afternoon natural light, whiteboard visible in background with "Q4 Goals" written on it
- Characters: Jovanny (32, 6'4", athletic build, fitted navy henley, standing near whiteboard, open body language) addresses Wei (28, Asian American, slim, black hoodie, glasses, sitting at table with laptop)
- Audio: Jovanny says: "Wei, I want your honest feedback on the new feature. Don't hold back." (enthusiastic, genuine tone)
- NO OTHER DIALOGUE

SEGMENT 2 (5-7 seconds):
- Camera: Handheld, push in slightly to medium close-up on Jovanny
- Scene: Same conference room
- Character: Jovanny's expression shifts from open to defensive, body language closes (arms starting to cross), face tightens
- Audio: Wei (off-camera) says: "Well, I think the user flow is a bit confusing—" Jovanny interrupts: "Actually, I think it's really intuitive because—" (defensive tone rising)
- DIALOGUE AS SPECIFIED

SEGMENT 3 (7-10 seconds):
- Camera: Quick whip pan to Wei, handheld, tight close-up on his face
- Scene: Same conference room, focus on Wei
- Character: Wei (deadpan expression, slight raise of eyebrows, direct eye contact with camera, the classic "Jim look" - one eyebrow slightly higher than the other, hint of smirk)
- Audio: NO DIALOGUE, ambient office sounds only (distant keyboard typing, HVAC hum)

VISUAL STYLE: The Office mockumentary style, handheld camera with natural shake, natural office lighting from windows, slightly desaturated colors, verite documentary feel, realistic office environment

CHARACTER DETAILS:
- Jovanny: 6'4" tall, athletic gym-bro build, 32 years old, broad shoulders, wearing fitted navy henley that shows physique, short well-maintained hair, confident posture that shifts to defensive
- Wei: 28 years old, Asian American (Chinese descent), slim build, 5'9", black-framed modern glasses, gray-black hoodie, naturally deadpan facial expressions, minimal movement
```

### Why This Works
- **Setup → Turn → Payoff** in 10 seconds
- Jovanny's blind spot (can't take feedback) immediately visible
- Wei's camera look does the comedic work without dialogue
- The silence in segment 3 lets the awkwardness breathe
- Visual contrast: Jovanny's physical defensiveness vs Wei's stillness

---

## EXAMPLE 2: "The Failed Demo" (30 seconds)
**Type:** Three-Beat Story
**Structure:** Setup → Complication → Payoff
**Characters:** Jovanny, Wei, Marcus (customer on Zoom)
**Scenario:** Product demo during customer call breaks catastrophically

### Sora 2 Prompt

```
[CLIP DURATION: 30 seconds]

SEGMENT 1 (0-10 seconds):
- Camera: Handheld mockumentary style, wide shot of conference room, slightly unstable
- Scene: Modern startup office conference room, large monitor visible showing Zoom call with customer (professional-looking person in suit), afternoon light through windows, QuickPing logo on wall
- Characters: Jovanny (32, 6'4", athletic, fitted charcoal quarter-zip, standing confidently gesturing at screen) and Wei (28, Asian American, slim, dark gray hoodie, glasses, sitting at table with laptop, hands on keyboard, skeptical expression)
- Audio: Jovanny says: "So let me show you our new campaign analytics feature. This is going to blow your mind." (confident, enthusiastic tone)
- DIALOGUE AS SPECIFIED, background ambient office sounds

SEGMENT 2 (10-12 seconds):
- Camera: Push in to medium shot of laptop screen, handheld
- Scene: Close-up of laptop screen showing QuickPing interface
- Action: Mouse cursor clicks on "Analytics Dashboard" button, loading spinner appears, then ERROR MESSAGE fills screen: "500 Internal Server Error - Database Connection Failed"
- Audio: Click sound, then error sound (system alert), Jovanny (off-camera): "Uh... that's... weird" (confidence crumbling)
- DIALOGUE AND SOUNDS AS SPECIFIED

SEGMENT 3 (12-18 seconds):
- Camera: Handheld, quick zoom out to capture both Jovanny and Wei, medium two-shot
- Scene: Same conference room, Zoom call still visible on monitor in background (customer's confused face)
- Characters: Jovanny (face dropping, forced smile, standing stiffly, hand moving to rub back of neck nervously) looking at Wei. Wei (typing on laptop, deadpan expression, not making eye contact, resigned posture)
- Audio: Jovanny says: "It was working literally five minutes ago. Wei, what's—" Wei interrupts flatly: "I told you to test it before the call." (Wei's tone is matter-of-fact, no emotion)
- DIALOGUE AS SPECIFIED

SEGMENT 4 (18-24 seconds):
- Camera: Tight close-up on Jovanny's face, handheld, slight zoom in
- Scene: Just Jovanny's face filling frame, monitor with customer barely visible in background out of focus
- Character: Jovanny (frozen smile, eyes slightly wide, visible sweat on forehead, attempting to maintain composure, jaw tight)
- Audio: Jovanny says to customer: "You know what, let's... let's reschedule this. I want to show you the full experience." (strained cheerfulness, voice slightly higher pitch)
- DIALOGUE AS SPECIFIED, nervous laugh at end

SEGMENT 5 (24-30 seconds):
- Camera: Static mockumentary talking head setup, medium close-up, plain office background (empty wall, slightly off-center)
- Scene: Talking head interview setup, neutral background
- Character: Wei (same outfit, sitting, centered in frame but slightly to left, looking directly at camera with deadpan expression, hands folded on table in front of him)
- Audio: Wei says: "That's the third demo that's broken this month. There's a pattern, but..." (pauses, slight head tilt, raises eyebrows) "...no one wants to talk about the pattern." (completely flat delivery, slight emphasis on "pattern" the second time)
- DIALOGUE AS SPECIFIED

VISUAL STYLE: The Office mockumentary style, handheld camera work with natural shake and occasional quick zooms, natural office lighting from windows creating soft shadows, slightly desaturated color grading with emphasis on grays and blues, verite documentary aesthetic, realistic office environment details

CHARACTER DETAILS:
- Jovanny: 6'4" tall (noticeably towers over Wei when standing), athletic gym-bro physique with broad shoulders and defined arms, 32 years old, short dark hair styled neatly, wearing fitted charcoal quarter-zip over collared shirt showing athletic build, confident body language that deteriorates to nervous
- Wei: 28 years old, Asian American (Chinese descent), slim build, 5'9", short dark hair, black-framed modern rectangular glasses, dark gray hoodie (slightly worn), naturally deadpan facial expressions with minimal movement, sits with relaxed but slightly slouched posture
```

### Why This Works
- **Full three-beat structure:** Confidence → Failure → Reflection
- Multiple character dynamics (Jovanny's delusion, Wei's "I told you so," customer's confusion)
- Visual progression: wide → detail → reaction → close-up → talking head
- Talking head provides commentary that recontextualizes the scene
- QuickPing platform visible (branded interface, error message)
- Wei's deadpan delivery in talking head is the punchline

## EXAMPLE 3: "The Rivalry Bug" (10 seconds)
**Type:** Visual + Platform Integration
**Structure:** The Contrast Cut
**Characters:** Wei, Raj
**Scenario:** Bug in production, Wei and Raj arguing over whose code caused it via QuickPing Slack

### Sora 2 Prompt

```
[CLIP DURATION: 10 seconds]

SEGMENT 1 (0-3 seconds):
- Camera: Handheld mockumentary style, close-up on computer monitor, slightly unstable
- Scene: Office desk, daytime, monitor showing QuickPing Slack-like interface, #engineering channel visible
- Visual: Screen shows rapid-fire messages appearing in QuickPing #engineering channel:
  Wei: "The bug is in the authentication module"
  Raj: "That's your code"
  Wei: "You refactored it last week"
  Raj: "I only changed formatting"
- Audio: NO DIALOGUE, only keyboard typing sounds (rapid clicks), message notification sounds (ding, ding, ding)

SEGMENT 2 (3-6 seconds):
- Camera: Quick whip pan right, handheld, medium shot
- Scene: Same office, focus on Wei at his desk
- Character: Wei (28, Asian American, slim, black hoodie, glasses, sitting at desk, hunched over laptop, typing aggressively, jaw clenched, eyes narrowed at screen, tense shoulders)
- Audio: Wei mutters under breath: "It's not formatting if you change the logic..." (annoyed, talking to screen)
- DIALOGUE AS SPECIFIED, continued keyboard typing sounds

SEGMENT 3 (6-10 seconds):
- Camera: Cut to laptop screen in Zoom window, handheld, medium close-up
- Scene: Small Zoom window showing Raj in his apartment (visible bookshelf behind him, warm lighting indicating evening/night in India)
- Character: Raj (26, Indian, slim, glasses, white button-up shirt, sitting up very straight, leaning toward camera with intense expression, pointing at screen off-camera)
- Audio: Raj says (with Indian accent): "Actually, if you look at the commit history—" (formal, pedantic tone, slightly elevated volume)
- DIALOGUE AS SPECIFIED
- Small text overlay in corner: "Bangalore, India - 2:30 AM"

VISUAL STYLE: The Office mockumentary style, handheld camera, natural office lighting, slightly desaturated colors, realistic office environment, QuickPing interface shown clearly on screen, verite documentary feel

CHARACTER DETAILS:
- Wei: 28 years old, Asian American, slim build, 5'9", black-framed glasses, black hoodie, focused intense expression when annoyed, minimal but tense body language
- Raj: 26 years old, Indian (from Bangalore), slim build, short dark hair, sometimes wears glasses, white button-up shirt (overdressed for remote work), earnest intense expression, modest apartment background with bookshelf
```

### Why This Works
- **Shows rather than tells** the rivalry through QuickPing messages
- Platform integration (QuickPing Slack-like interface is central)
- Remote dynamic visible (Wei in office, Raj on Zoom from India at 2am)
- Time zone martyrdom implied (timestamp showing 2:30 AM)
- No resolution - just escalating tension (Office-style incomplete endings)
- Visual variety: screen → person → remote person

## EXAMPLE 4: "Zoe Gets Away With It" (10 seconds)
**Type:** The Double Standard
**Structure:** The Contrast Cut
**Characters:** Zoe, Sarah, Wei (talking head)
**Scenario:** Zoe makes catastrophic mistake, everyone forgives her immediately

### Sora 2 Prompt

```
[CLIP DURATION: 10 seconds]

SEGMENT 1 (0-4 seconds):
- Camera: Handheld mockumentary style, medium shot, slightly unstable
- Scene: Open office space, afternoon natural light, desks with monitors visible, QuickPing logo on wall in background
- Characters: Zoe (21, petite 5'3", long blonde hair, wearing trendy cropped blazer over graphic tee, standing at desk looking at laptop screen with big innocent eyes, hand over mouth) next to Sarah (34, average build 5'5", brown hair in ponytail, wearing cardigan, standing beside her with concerned but patient expression)
- Audio: Zoe says: "Ohmigod Sarah, I think I... I accidentally deleted the entire customer email list?" (sweet voice with upspeak, vocal fry, genuinely apologetic tone, slight nervous laugh)
- DIALOGUE AS SPECIFIED

SEGMENT 2 (4-7 seconds):
- Camera: Handheld, medium two-shot, slight push in
- Scene: Same office location
- Characters: Sarah (tight professional smile, hand on Zoe's shoulder reassuringly, nodding, warm expression despite clear concern in eyes) and Zoe (puppy dog eyes, innocent sweet expression, hands clasped together apologetically)
- Audio: Sarah says: "It's okay! That's what backups are for. Don't worry about it, you're still learning." (warm, patient tone, slight strain beneath forced cheerfulness)
- DIALOGUE AS SPECIFIED

SEGMENT 3 (7-10 seconds):
- Camera: Cut to static mockumentary talking head setup, medium close-up, plain background
- Scene: Talking head interview setup, neutral office wall background
- Character: Wei (28, Asian American, slim, gray hoodie, black-framed glasses, sitting slightly off-center, looking directly at camera with signature deadpan expression, slight head shake)
- Audio: Wei says: "Last month I had a typo in a variable name and I got a thirty-minute lecture about code quality." (pause, raised eyebrows) "She deleted twelve thousand customer emails." (completely flat delivery, slight emphasis on "twelve thousand")
- DIALOGUE AS SPECIFIED

VISUAL STYLE: The Office mockumentary style, handheld camera work with natural movement in office scenes, static locked-off camera for talking head, natural office lighting, slightly desaturated colors, verite documentary feel

CHARACTER DETAILS:
- Zoe: 21 years old, petite build, 5'3", conventionally attractive, long blonde hair (styled nicely), wearing trendy outfit (cropped blazer, fashionable), big expressive eyes, sweet innocent demeanor, youthful energy
- Sarah: 34 years old, average build, 5'5", brown hair in simple ponytail, wearing comfortable cardigan over blouse, minimal makeup, warm but tired expression, motherly patience
- Wei: 28 years old, Asian American, slim build, 5'9", short dark hair, black-framed glasses, gray hoodie, naturally deadpan facial expressions, minimal movement
```

### Why This Works
- **Perfect contrast structure:** Disaster → Forgiveness → Commentary
- Zoe's character trait (gets away with everything) immediately clear
- The double standard is the joke (Wei's talking head makes it explicit)
- Sarah's patience vs her actual stress (visible in eyes despite smile)
- Wei as audience surrogate pointing out the absurdity
- Specific numbers ("twelve thousand") make the contrast funnier

## EXAMPLE 5: "Gym Bro Jovanny" (30 seconds)
**Type:** Character Showcase
**Structure:** Three-Beat with Contrast
**Characters:** Jovanny, Marcus
**Scenario:** Jovanny trying to bond with Marcus over gym/being cool, Marcus's complete disinterest

### Sora 2 Prompt

```
[CLIP DURATION: 30 seconds]

SEGMENT 1 (0-8 seconds):
- Camera: Handheld mockumentary style, wide shot, following action, slightly unstable
- Scene: Office kitchen area, afternoon, coffee maker visible, snack shelf in background, bright fluorescent lighting mixed with natural window light
- Characters: Marcus (23, 5'11", athletic build, wearing designer streetwear - fitted black t-shirt, clean sneakers, fresh fade haircut, simple chain) pouring coffee. Jovanny (32, 6'4" - noticeably towers over Marcus, athletic gym-bro build, wearing fitted heather gray henley showing physique, styled hair) walks up energetically
- Audio: Jovanny says: "Yo Marcus! What's good bro?" (trying to sound casual/cool, slightly forced enthusiasm) Marcus responds: "Hey" (polite, minimal, not matching energy) Jovanny continues: "You hitting the gym today? I'm about to go crush some deadlifts after work." (enthusiastic, seeking engagement)
- DIALOGUE AS SPECIFIED

SEGMENT 2 (8-11 seconds):
- Camera: Handheld, medium close-up on Marcus, slight push in
- Scene: Same kitchen, focus on Marcus
- Character: Marcus (holding coffee cup, giving signature side-eye to camera - eyes cut to camera without moving head, subtle expression of "here we go again," slight pursing of lips, controlled polite expression)
- Audio: NO DIALOGUE, ambient kitchen sounds (coffee maker gurgling, distant office chatter), Marcus takes sip of coffee
- SILENCE IS KEY HERE

SEGMENT 3 (11-19 seconds):
- Camera: Handheld, medium two-shot, capturing height difference clearly
- Scene: Same kitchen
- Characters: Jovanny (animated body language, flexing arm slightly while talking, taking up space, leaning toward Marcus) and Marcus (closed body language, leaning slightly away, holding coffee cup as barrier, minimal eye contact)
- Audio: Jovanny says: "I'm up to 285 on deadlift now. Used to be 300 but you know, cut back a bit for mobility." (bragging but trying to sound humble, seeking validation) Marcus responds: "...Okay." (flat, one word, sipping coffee) Jovanny continues undeterred: "Yeah man, mobility is key. You lift bro?" Marcus: "Not really" (short, clearly wanting to exit)
- DIALOGUE AS SPECIFIED

SEGMENT 4 (19-25 seconds):
- Camera: Static mockumentary talking head setup, medium close-up, neutral background
- Scene: Talking head interview, plain office wall
- Character: Jovanny (same outfit, centered in frame, sitting up straight with confident posture, gesturing with hands while talking, earnest enthusiastic expression)
- Audio: Jovanny says: "Marcus and I have like, a real connection. Very mentor-mentee vibe. I think he really looks up to me." (completely sincere, nodding, genuine belief in what he's saying, slight smile)
- DIALOGUE AS SPECIFIED

SEGMENT 5 (25-30 seconds):
- Camera: Static mockumentary talking head setup, medium close-up, neutral background (same setup as Jovanny's)
- Scene: Talking head interview, plain office wall
- Character: Marcus (same outfit, sitting slightly to side, relaxed posture, looking at camera with subtle skeptical expression, slight head shake)
- Audio: Marcus says: "I don't know what he's talking about." (pause, deadpan, slight shrug) "He's... he means well, I guess." (diplomatic but clearly doesn't share Jovanny's perception)
- DIALOGUE AS SPECIFIED

VISUAL STYLE: The Office mockumentary style, handheld camera work in office scenes with natural movement and occasional quick zooms, static locked-off camera for talking heads, natural mixed lighting (fluorescent and window light in kitchen), slightly desaturated color grading, verite documentary aesthetic, realistic office environment

CHARACTER DETAILS:
- Jovanny: 6'4" tall (HEIGHT DIFFERENCE with Marcus is VISIBLY CLEAR in frame - he towers over him), 32 years old, athletic gym-bro physique with broad shoulders and defined arms visible through fitted clothes, wearing heather gray fitted henley that shows his build, short dark hair styled with product, high-energy body language, uses hands when talking, takes up physical space, tries too hard to seem casual/cool
- Marcus: 23 years old, 5'11", athletic build but more naturally so, Black, fresh fade haircut, facial hair neatly trimmed, wearing designer streetwear (fitted black t-shirt, nice sneakers), simple gold chain, confident but controlled energy, minimal reactive expressions, masters the art of the side-eye, polite but disengaged body language
```

### Why This Works
- **Complete character study:** Shows Jovanny's blind spots (trying too hard, thinks Marcus likes him, gym bro identity)
- **Generational/cultural gap:** Millennial trying to connect with Gen Z, completely missing
- **Physical comedy:** Height difference visible, Jovanny's animated energy vs Marcus's stillness
- **The contrast:** Jovanny's talking head vs Marcus's talking head is the punchline
- **Marcus's side-eye:** Perfect "Jim to camera" moment without breaking scene
- **Silence in segment 2:** Lets Marcus's reaction breathe, no dialogue needed
- **Cringe factor:** Audience feels Jovanny's try-hard energy failing in real-time

## TIPS FOR USING THESE EXAMPLES

### Adapting These Templates

1. **Swap characters:** Use same structure but different character pairings
2. **Change scenario:** Keep timing/camera work but different situation
3. **Adjust duration:** Extend 10s to 30s by adding setup or compress 30s to 10s by cutting beats
4. **Platform integration:** Add QuickPing UI elements where relevant

### What Makes These Sora-Ready

- **Explicit timestamps:** Every segment has clear start/end times
- **Camera specifications:** Each segment describes camera position, movement, style
- **Dialogue handling:** Either in quotes or explicitly "NO DIALOGUE"
- **Character descriptions:** Physical details pulled from characters.md
- **Visual style:** Consistent mockumentary aesthetic specified
- **Silence noted:** When silence is important, it's explicitly stated
- **Sound design:** Ambient sounds specified to prevent Sora from adding unwanted audio

### Common Patterns

**For 10-second clips:**
- 3-4 seconds: Setup
- 3-4 seconds: Turn/escalation
- 3-4 seconds: Payoff/reaction

**For 30-second clips:**
- 8-10 seconds: Setup (establish situation)
- 8-12 seconds: Complication (things get worse)
- 8-12 seconds: Payoff (punchline, often talking head)

**Camera progression:**
- Wide → Medium → Close-up (builds tension)
- Scene → Reaction → Talking head (context → moment → commentary)
- Location → Screen detail → Back to location (platform integration)

**Talking head usage:**
- Can open clip (sets up what we're about to see)
- Can close clip (reflects on what we just saw) ← more common in Office style
- Can provide contrast (character's perception vs reality)
