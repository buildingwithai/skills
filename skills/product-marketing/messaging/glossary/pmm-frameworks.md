## Positioning Frameworks

### April Dunford's Positioning Framework

**Source:** [Obviously Awesome](https://www.aprildunford.com/) by April Dunford

**5 Components:**
1. **Competitive alternatives** - What would customers do if you didn't exist?
2. **Unique attributes** - What features/capabilities do you have that alternatives don't?
3. **Value** - What value do those attributes deliver?
4. **Target customers** - Who cares most about that value?
5. **Market category** - What market context makes your value obvious?

**When to use:** Creating or refreshing product positioning

**Key insight:** Positioning is context-setting for your product

## Messaging Frameworks

### Pain-Claim-Gain

**Source:** Anthony Pierri (positioning messaging expert)

**3 Components:**
1. **Pain** - The problem your customer has (make it specific and personal)
2. **Claim** - How your product solves it (your solution)
3. **Gain** - The outcome/benefit they get (why they should care)

**Example:**
- **Pain:** "Sales teams waste 10+ hours per week on manual data entry"
- **Claim:** "Our CRM auto-captures every customer interaction"
- **Gain:** "So reps spend time selling, not updating spreadsheets"

**When to use:** Creating value propositions, landing page copy, sales messaging

**Used in:**

### Message Architecture (Hierarchy)

**3 Levels:**
1. **Brand messaging** - Company-level (who you are, what you stand for)
2. **Product messaging** - Product-level (what this product does)
3. **Feature messaging** - Feature-level (specific capabilities)

**Structure within each:**
- **Pillars** (3-5 key themes)
- **Proof points** (evidence for each pillar)
- **Channel adaptations** (how it changes by channel)

**When to use:** Organizing comprehensive messaging for multiple channels
