# Pricing Messaging

Master how to talk about price and value so customers focus on ROI instead of cost.

## Overview

**The challenge**: Talking about pricing is uncomfortable. Most companies either avoid it or default to discounting.

**The opportunity**: How you talk about pricing dramatically affects perceived value, deal size, and win rate.

**Key principle**: Price is never just a number. It's a message about value, positioning, and who you're for.

## The Pricing Messaging Framework

### Rule 1: Lead with Value, Not Price

**Wrong approach**:
- "Our software costs $50/user/month"
- Focuses on cost
- Invites price comparison
- No context for value

**Right approach**:
- "Companies using our software reduce support costs by $100K/year while improving customer satisfaction by 35%. That ROI typically pays for our $50/user/month investment in the first quarter."
- Leads with value
- Provides ROI context
- Makes price feel small relative to value

**Framework**: [Outcome] + [Evidence] + [Price as investment in that outcome]

### Rule 2: Make Price Relative to Something

**Price feels different depending on comparison**:

**Compare to cost of problem**:
- "You're spending $200K/year on manual processing. Our solution is $40K/year."
- Price is 20% of problem cost (feels cheap)

**Compare to cost of alternatives**:
- "Enterprise solutions cost $150K+ and take 6 months to implement. We're $40K and you're live in 2 weeks."
- Positioned as better value

**Compare to cost of inaction**:
- "Every month you delay costs you $15K in lost efficiency. Our $40K annual investment pays for itself in under 3 months."
- Makes decision urgent

**Compare to other business costs**:
- "Most companies spend 3-5% of revenue on [category]. At $40K, you're investing less than 1%."
- Frames as reasonable business expense

**Key**: Never present price in isolation. Always provide context.

### Rule 3: Anchor High, Adjust Down

**Anchoring effect**: First number heard becomes reference point for all future numbers.

**Strategy**:
1. Anchor with the expensive option or full implementation
2. Then show how they can start smaller
3. Final price feels reasonable by comparison

**Example**:
"Our enterprise solution with all modules runs $150K annually for organizations your size. However, most companies start with our core platform at $50K, then add modules as needed. Some teams begin with just the essentials at $25K to prove ROI before expanding."

**Why it works**:
- $150K anchors their expectation
- $50K feels moderate
- $25K feels like a deal
- You never led with "$25K" (would feel expensive without context)

### Rule 4: Package Pricing with Value

**Don't sell price, sell packages**:

**Bad** (price-focused):
- Basic: $10/user
- Pro: $25/user
- Enterprise: $50/user

**Good** (value-focused):
- **Starter** ($10/user): Get up and running fast
  - Core features for small teams
  - Email support
  - Monthly billing
  - *Best for: Teams of 5-15 just getting started*

- **Professional** ($25/user): Scale with confidence
  - Everything in Starter
  - Advanced analytics and reporting
  - Priority support
  - Annual billing with 20% discount
  - *Best for: Growing teams (15-50) needing deeper insights*

- **Enterprise** ($50/user): Built for your needs
  - Everything in Professional
  - Custom integrations
  - Dedicated success manager
  - SLA guarantees
  - *Best for: Organizations (50+) with complex requirements*

**Key differences**:
- Packages have names (not tiers)
- Each package tells you who it's for
- Benefits listed, not just features
- Value proposition for each level

### Rule 5: Use Value Metrics That Align with Customer Success

**Pricing metric sends a message about what you value**:

**Per user pricing**:
- Message: "We succeed when your team grows"
- Works for: Collaboration tools, team software
- Risk: Customers limit users to control costs

**Usage-based pricing**:
- Message: "Pay for what you use, scale as you grow"
- Works for: Infrastructure, APIs, consumption-based products
- Risk: Unpredictable costs can scare customers

**Flat fee pricing**:
- Message: "Predictable costs, unlimited use"
- Works for: When you want to encourage adoption
- Risk: Can leave money on table with high-usage customers

**Value-based pricing**:
- Message: "Pay for results, not activity"
- Works for: When value is clearly measurable
- Risk: Requires strong proof of value delivery

**Outcome-based pricing**:
- Message: "We only make money when you succeed"
- Works for: When outcome is binary and measurable
- Risk: Takes on customer's risk

**Example**: Revenue intelligence tool
- ❌ Per user: Limits sales team adoption
- ❌ Per meeting: Discourages using tool on all calls
- ✅ Per deal tracked: Aligns with customer success (more deals = more value for both)

### Rule 6: Address Price Early (On Your Terms)

**The mistake**: Avoiding price until forced to share it

**The problem**: 
- Builds mystery and anxiety
- Lets competitors frame your pricing
- Wastes time with unqualified prospects
- Positions price as the problem

**Better approach**: Address pricing proactively but with context

**Early in sales cycle**:
"Happy to share pricing. First, let me ask a few questions so I can give you an accurate number based on your needs..."
[Qualify, understand value]
"Based on what you've shared, here's the typical investment range for companies your size: $X-$Y annually. Does that align with your budget?"

**On website**:
Option 1: Show pricing publicly with context
Option 2: "Investment starts at $X" with calculator or "Get pricing"
Option 3: "Pricing is customized based on [factors]. Let's talk" (only if truly custom)

**Why this works**:
- Qualifies budget fit early
- You control the narrative
- Price isn't the focus, value is
- Unqualified prospects self-select out

## Pricing Objection Handling

### "You're too expensive"

**Don't**: Immediately discount or get defensive

**Do**: Understand what "expensive" means

**Response framework**:
1. **Empathize**: "I understand price is a consideration"
2. **Clarify**: "Help me understand - compared to what?"
3. **Reframe**: Show ROI/value
4. **Confirm fit**: "If we could show [ROI], does this solve the right problem?"

**Example**:
"I hear you. Help me understand what you're comparing us to? 

[If comparing to competitor]: "Let's look at total cost over 12 months, including [implementation time, training, maintenance]. Here's what our customers found..."

[If comparing to doing nothing]: "What's your current cost for [problem we solve]? Our customers typically find we're 1/5th the cost of their current approach when you factor in [labor, errors, opportunity cost]."

[If just sticker shock]: "I understand the investment feels significant. Let me show you what Company X achieved in their first 90 days [specific ROI]. Would results like that make this a worthwhile investment?"

### "We can build it ourselves"

**Don't**: Say "no you can't" or trash internal builds

**Do**: Show true cost of build + maintain

**Response framework**:
"That's a fair consideration. Let's look at what it really takes:

**Build cost**:
- 2-3 engineers x 6 months = $150K-200K
- Product management = $50K
- Design = $25K
- **Total build: ~$250K**

**Ongoing cost**:
- Maintenance (2 engineers 20% time) = $75K/year
- Infrastructure = $10K/year
- Security updates and compliance = $25K/year
- Feature development to keep competitive = $100K+/year
- **Total ongoing: ~$200K+/year**

**Our pricing**: $40K/year, maintained and improved continuously.

**The question isn't 'can you build it' (you probably can). It's 'should your engineers build internal tools instead of building what makes you money?' Most of our customers decided their engineering team should focus on their core product, not rebuilding what we've already built."

### "I need to see ROI"

**Don't**: Provide generic ROI calculator

**Do**: Build specific business case for them

**Response framework**:
"Let's build your specific business case together.

**Current state**:
- How many [relevant unit]? [e.g., support tickets, sales calls, invoices]
- Current cost per [unit]?
- Current time to [outcome]?
- Cost of errors/delays?

**Future state with us**:
- Reduce [process] from [X] to [Y]
- Eliminate [Z] hours of manual work
- Decrease errors by [%]
- Faster [outcome] by [timeframe]

**Your ROI**:
- Monthly savings: $[X]
- Annual savings: $[Y]
- Our annual cost: $[Z]
- ROI: [Y/Z]x return
- Payback: [Z/X] months

Does this kind of return make sense for your business?"

### "I need to compare alternatives"

**Don't**: Bad-mouth competitors or say "we're all the same"

**Do**: Help them compare thoughtfully

**Response framework**:
"You should definitely evaluate alternatives. Here's what I'd recommend you compare:

**Beyond features**, look at:
- Implementation time (We're [X], others are [Y])
- Time to value (Our customers see results in [timeframe])
- Ongoing costs (Training, maintenance, upgrades)
- Customer success resources (What support do you get?)
- Product roadmap (Where are they investing?)

**Questions to ask competitors**:
- [Question that highlights your strength 1]
- [Question that exposes their weakness 1]
- [Question about total cost of ownership]

When you're ready to compare, I'm happy to walk through what you find."

**Why this works**:
- Positions you as trusted advisor
- Frames comparison around your strengths
- Makes you seem confident, not threatened
- Provides value even if they choose competitor

## Messaging by Deal Size

### Small Deals (<$25K)

**Focus**: Fast ROI, easy to get started

**Pricing message**:
"Most teams start with [package] at $X/month. You'll see ROI in [specific timeframe]. If you sign up today, you're live by [date]."

**Emphasis**:
- Quick implementation
- Fast time to value
- Low risk ("Try it for [timeframe]")
- Self-serve or light-touch sales

### Mid-Market Deals ($25K-$250K)

**Focus**: Business case, proven results

**Pricing message**:
"Companies like [similar company] typically invest $X-$Y annually. They see [specific ROI] within [timeframe]. Here's how we'd structure this for you..."

**Emphasis**:
- Similar customer success stories
- Clear ROI calculation
- Implementation plan
- Ongoing support

### Enterprise Deals ($250K+)

**Focus**: Strategic partnership, custom solution

**Pricing message**:
"Given your requirements around [specific needs], we'd propose a custom solution at $X annually. This includes [specific value points]. Here's the business case we'd build with your CFO..."

**Emphasis**:
- Strategic alignment
- Custom configuration
- Executive-level value
- Long-term partnership
- Risk mitigation

## Discount Strategy

**Key principle**: Discounting is not a pricing strategy. It's a failure to communicate value.

### When to Discount (Strategically)

**Acceptable reasons**:
1. **Annual prepayment**: 15-20% discount for annual vs monthly
   - Improves cash flow
   - Increases customer commitment
   - Reduces churn risk

2. **Multi-year commitment**: Additional 10-15% for 2-3 year deals
   - Predictable revenue
   - Customer lock-in
   - Reduces sales cost

3. **Volume**: Tiered pricing for larger deployments
   - Marginal cost decreases
   - Strategic account value
   - Market penetration

4. **Early adopter/reference**: 20-30% for being case study + reference
   - Marketing value
   - Proof for future customers
   - Only for strategic accounts

**How to message discounts**:
❌ "I can give you 20% off" (devalues product)
✅ "If you're able to commit annually instead of monthly, we offer 20% savings" (frames as their choice)

❌ "Just for you, 15% off" (feels arbitrary)
✅ "For customers willing to be a reference account, we invest 15% back as a discount" (frames as exchange of value)

### When NOT to Discount

**Red flags**:
- "I need a discount to close this"
- "Our competitor is cheaper"
- "It's end of quarter, give me a deal"
- "We're a [nonprofit/startup/small company]"

**Instead of discounting**:

**1. Add value**:
- Extra training sessions
- Implementation support
- Extended trial
- Additional users
- Faster onboarding

**2. Change terms**:
- Longer payment terms
- Phased rollout (start smaller)
- Pilot program first
- Delayed start date

**3. Remove features**:
- Start with smaller package
- Fewer users initially
- Basic support tier
- Fewer integrations

**4. Confirm value fit**:
"If price is the only issue, I'm concerned we haven't proven the value. Let me show you..."

## Pricing Messaging by Channel

### Website

**Public pricing approach**:

**Option 1: Fully transparent**
- Show all tiers and prices
- Best for: Self-serve products, standard pricing
- Message: "No games, no surprises"

**Option 2: Starting price**
- "Plans start at $X"
- Best for: Multiple tiers, usage-based
- Message: "Flexible options for every size"

**Option 3: Custom pricing**
- "Pricing tailored to your needs"
- Best for: Enterprise, highly variable
- Message: "Built for your specific requirements"

**Website pricing section must include**:
- Value proposition (what you get)
- Who each plan is for
- Key differentiators per tier
- Social proof (customers, ratings)
- Clear CTA (Try free, Contact sales)
- FAQ addressing price concerns

### Sales Conversations

**Discovery phase**:
"Before we get to specific numbers, let me understand what success looks like for you..."
[Qualify, understand value, build business case]

**Pricing reveal**:
"Based on what you've shared, here's what the investment looks like..."
[Present value first, then price, then ROI]

**Follow-up**:
"How does that compare to your budget expectations?"
[Address concerns, don't immediately discount]

### Proposals

**Structure**:
1. **Executive summary**: The problem and your solution
2. **Business case**: ROI calculation specific to them
3. **Scope**: What's included
4. **Investment**: Pricing broken down clearly
5. **Implementation**: Timeline and plan
6. **Success metrics**: How you'll measure ROI
7. **Terms**: Contract details
8. **Next steps**: Clear path forward

**Pricing section format**:
- Start with total value delivered
- Then show investment required
- Include what's included
- Add options/add-ons
- Show total cost of ownership
- Compare to alternatives

### Email

**Cold outreach** (don't lead with price):
"Companies like yours typically see [outcome] using [approach]. Would that be valuable?"

**Follow-up after demo**:
"As promised, here's the investment for [company name]:
- [Package]: $X [frequency]
- Includes: [specific value for them]
- ROI based on our discussion: [their numbers]
- Next step: [clear CTA]"

### Ads/Content

**Don't**: Lead with price in ads (no context)
**Do**: Use price to qualify
- "Solutions starting at $10K" (filters out sub-$10K buyers)
- "Enterprise platform for mid-market companies" (sets expectations)

## Pricing Communication Checklist

Before you share pricing, ensure you can answer:

**Value questions**:
- ✅ What specific problem does this solve for them?
- ✅ What's the cost of not solving it?
- ✅ What outcomes will they achieve?
- ✅ How quickly will they see results?
- ✅ Do we have proof (similar customers)?

**Pricing questions**:
- ✅ What's the right package/tier for them?
- ✅ What are they comparing us to?
- ✅ What's their budget/approval process?
- ✅ What's included vs extra cost?
- ✅ Are there any concerns about price?

**Justification questions**:
- ✅ Can we build them a business case?
- ✅ What's the ROI calculation?
- ✅ How does this compare to alternatives?
- ✅ What's the risk if they don't move forward?
- ✅ Who needs to approve and what do they care about?

## Common Pricing Messaging Mistakes

1. **Hiding price**: Creates distrust and wastes everyone's time

2. **Leading with price**: No context for value, invites rejection

3. **Competing only on price**: Race to the bottom, devalues product

4. **Inconsistent pricing**: Different reps quote different prices

5. **Discounting without reason**: Trains customers to expect discounts

6. **Complex pricing**: Confused customers don't buy

7. **Wrong comparison**: Comparing to wrong alternatives

8. **No ROI proof**: Can't justify investment

9. **One-size-fits-all**: Same pitch regardless of deal size

10. **Apologizing for price**: "I know it's expensive but..." undermines value

## Pricing Confidence

**Your pricing is a message about**:
- Quality (cheap = low quality)
- Positioning (who you're for)
- Value delivered (price = value proxy)
- Business model (sustainable vs racing to zero)

**Confident pricing messaging**:
- ✅ "Our investment is $X"
- ✅ "That includes [specific value]"
- ✅ "Our customers see [ROI] within [timeframe]"
- ✅ "Does that align with your budget?"

**Not confident**:
- ❌ "Unfortunately it costs $X"
- ❌ "I know it's expensive but..."
- ❌ "Maybe I can get approval for a discount"
- ❌ "Is that too much?"

**Remember**: If you don't believe in your pricing, customers won't either.
