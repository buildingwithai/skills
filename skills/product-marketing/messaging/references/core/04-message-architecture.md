# Message Architecture

Organize your messages into a clear, scalable hierarchy that works across all channels and audiences.

## Overview

Message architecture is the organizing structure for all your messaging. It ensures consistency while allowing flexibility across different channels, audiences, and contexts.

**Why you need it:**
- Prevents messaging chaos as your company grows
- Ensures consistency across channels
- Makes it easier to adapt messages for different contexts
- Provides clear guidelines for everyone creating content
- Scales from homepage copy to sales emails to ads

**What it covers:**
- Messaging hierarchy (brand → product → feature)
- Pillars and proof points structure
- Channel adaptation guidelines
- How to maintain consistency while adapting

## The Messaging Hierarchy

Your messaging exists at three levels. Each level has a different purpose and audience.

### Level 1: Brand Messaging (Highest Level)

**What it is**: The overarching story about your company and its mission.

**Purpose**: 
- Establishes who you are and why you exist
- Differentiates your company (not just products)
- Appeals to a broad audience
- Rarely changes

**Components**:
- **Mission**: Why your company exists
- **Vision**: Where you're headed
- **Values**: What you believe
- **Brand promise**: What customers can expect

**Example** (Slack):
- Mission: Make work life simpler, more pleasant, and more productive
- Vision: A world where work flows
- Brand promise: Bring your team together

**When to use**: Company-level communications (About Us page, recruiting, investor relations, brand campaigns)

**Timeline**: Review annually, update every 2-3 years

### Level 2: Product Messaging (Middle Level)

**What it is**: The specific value proposition for a product or product line.

**Purpose**:
- Explains what the product does and for whom
- Articulates differentiated value
- Connects to specific customer needs
- May evolve as product and market change

**Components**:
- **Positioning statement**: One-sentence core value prop
- **Messaging pillars**: 3-5 key themes (detailed below)
- **Proof points**: Evidence for each pillar
- **Persona-specific variations**: How pillars adapt for different buyers

**Example** (Asana):
- Positioning: Work management platform that helps teams orchestrate work, from daily tasks to strategic initiatives
- Pillars: Clarity, accountability, flexibility, connected work
- Proof points: Real-time dashboards, automated workflows, 200+ integrations

**When to use**: Product pages, product marketing materials, sales decks, demo scripts, product-specific campaigns

**Timeline**: Review quarterly, update every 6-12 months

### Level 3: Feature Messaging (Lowest Level)

**What it is**: Specific messages about individual features or capabilities.

**Purpose**:
- Explains specific functionality
- Shows how features deliver value
- Enables tactical campaigns
- Changes frequently as features ship

**Components**:
- **Feature name**: What you call it
- **One-liner**: What it does
- **Value statement**: Why it matters
- **Use cases**: When to use it
- **Specs/details**: Technical specifics

**Example** (Notion AI):
- Feature name: Notion AI
- One-liner: AI assistant that writes, summarizes, and organizes with you
- Value: Save hours on routine writing tasks
- Use cases: Draft project plans, summarize meeting notes, organize research
- Specs: Powered by GPT-4, available in all workspaces

**When to use**: Feature announcements, in-product tooltips, help docs, launch campaigns, tactical ads

**Timeline**: Changes with every release

## Messaging Pillars

Pillars are the 3-5 core themes that support your positioning. They're the backbone of your product messaging.

### Why Pillars Matter

**Without pillars**: 
- Every team creates different messages
- Sales reps emphasize random features
- Messaging gets bloated and confusing
- No clear differentiation

**With pillars**:
- Everyone tells the same core story
- Easy to adapt for different contexts
- Clear, memorable, repeatable
- Scalable across channels

### How Many Pillars?

**3-5 pillars is the sweet spot.**

- **Too few (1-2)**: Not enough substance to support claim
- **Just right (3-5)**: Memorable, substantial, flexible
- **Too many (6+)**: Diluted, forgettable, hard to use

### Pillar Structure

Each pillar should have:

**1. Pillar name** (2-4 words)
- Clear, memorable label
- Can be customer-facing or internal

**2. Pillar statement** (1 sentence)
- What this pillar means
- The core benefit or capability

**3. Proof points** (3-5 per pillar)
- Evidence that supports the pillar
- Mix of features, data, and customer outcomes

**4. Supporting details**
- How it works
- Why it matters
- Who cares most

### Example: Pillars for a CRM

**Pillar 1: Complete Customer View**
- Statement: See everything about every customer in one place
- Proof points:
  - Unified customer profiles with contact, company, and activity data
  - Automatic enrichment from 50+ data sources
  - See every email, call, meeting, and deal in chronological timeline
  - Custom fields for industry-specific data
- Works because: Reps waste hours searching for customer info across tools
- Matters for: P1 (sales reps) and P2 (sales managers)

**Pillar 2: Revenue Intelligence**
- Statement: Know which deals will close and why
- Proof points:
  - AI-powered deal scoring based on 50+ signals
  - Pipeline forecasting with 95% accuracy
  - Automatically identify at-risk deals
  - Coaching recommendations for every deal
- Works because: Sales leaders make decisions based on gut feel, not data
- Matters for: P3 (VP Sales, CFO) and P2 (sales managers)

**Pillar 3: Workflow Automation**
- Statement: Eliminate repetitive tasks so reps can sell
- Proof points:
  - Automate follow-ups based on deal stage
  - Smart reminders for next best actions
  - One-click dialing and email logging
  - Auto-create tasks from meeting notes
- Works because: Reps spend 40% of time on admin, not selling
- Matters for: P1 (sales reps) and P2 (sales managers)

**Pillar 4: Rapid Onboarding**
- Statement: Get your team selling in days, not months
- Proof points:
  - Guided setup wizard completes configuration in 30 minutes
  - Import contacts and deals from any CRM
  - Built-in templates for common sales processes
  - In-app training and certification
- Works because: CRM implementations typically take 3-6 months
- Matters for: P3 (IT, buyers evaluating risk) and P2 (champions)

### Adapting Pillars by Audience

**For Technical Audiences** (P1):
- Lead with "how" and capabilities
- Emphasize features and specs
- Provide technical depth

**For Champions** (P2):
- Lead with "what" outcomes
- Emphasize proof and social proof
- Provide internal selling ammunition

**For Economic Buyers** (P3):
- Lead with "why" and business value
- Emphasize ROI and risk reduction
- Provide executive-level framing

**Example adaptation** of "Complete Customer View" pillar:

- **P1 (Sales Rep)**: "Stop wasting time hunting for customer info. Every email, call, and deal detail is right there in one unified timeline. Custom fields let you track anything specific to your sales process."

- **P2 (Sales Manager)**: "Give your reps one place to find everything about every customer. Teams using unified customer views close 25% more deals because reps spend time selling, not searching. Companies like [Customer] saw immediate productivity gains."

- **P3 (VP Sales)**: "Scattered customer data costs you deals. A unified customer view improves rep productivity by 30% and increases win rates by 25%. ROI in 90 days based on time savings alone."

## Channel Adaptation

Your core pillars stay consistent, but how you express them varies by channel.

### Channel Types

**High-context channels**: More space, audience is actively engaged
- Website pages
- Sales decks
- Whitepapers
- Webinars
- Demo scripts

**Low-context channels**: Limited space, audience is distracted
- Ads (display, social)
- Email subject lines
- Social posts
- SMS
- In-product tooltips

### Adaptation Guidelines

#### 1. Homepage (High-context, broad audience)

**Structure**:
- Hero: One-sentence positioning
- Subhead: Who it's for + what they gain
- 3 pillars: One section each with visuals
- Social proof: Logos, quotes, metrics
- CTA: Clear next step

**Example**:
```
[HERO]
Work management that actually works

[SUBHEAD]
Help your team coordinate work, from daily tasks to strategic initiatives, 
so they can move faster and accomplish more.

[PILLAR 1: Visual + headline]
Everything in one place
Never lose track of work again. See all projects, tasks, and timelines in 
one connected workspace.

[PILLAR 2: Visual + headline]
Automated workflows
Eliminate manual work with rules that automatically route, assign, and update 
tasks as work progresses.

[PILLAR 3: Visual + headline]
Real-time visibility
Know what's happening, what's blocked, and what's on track with live dashboards.
```

#### 2. Product Page (High-context, buying-stage audience)

**Structure**:
- Positioning statement
- All pillars with proof points
- Use cases
- Integration details
- Pricing/packaging
- Customer stories
- Technical specs (if technical audience)

**Emphasis**: Depth over brevity. Provide everything a buyer needs to evaluate.

#### 3. Sales Deck (High-context, meeting scenario)

**Structure**:
- Problem slide: Their pain
- Solution slide: Your positioning
- One slide per pillar: Proof points + visuals
- How it works: Demo screenshots or diagram
- Customer proof: Logo slide + case study
- Next steps: CTA

**Adaptation**: Customize pain + use cases for specific prospect. Pillar selection can vary based on what matters to them.

#### 4. Email (Low-context, skimmable)

**Structure**:
- Subject: Benefit or curiosity
- Opening: One-sentence problem
- Body: One pillar, one proof point
- CTA: One clear action

**Example**:
```
Subject: Cut status meetings by 80%

Hi [Name],

Most product teams waste 10+ hours/week in status meetings just to figure out 
what's happening.

[Product] gives everyone real-time visibility into what's done, what's in 
progress, and what's blocked — so you only meet when you need to actually 
make decisions.

[Customer] cut status meetings from 2 hours/day to 30 minutes/week.

Want to see how? [CTA]
```

**Key principle**: One pillar, one proof point, one CTA. Don't overwhelm.

#### 5. Social Post (Low-context, scroll-past scenario)

**Structure**:
- Hook: Problem or surprising stat
- Insight: One pillar benefit
- CTA or tag: Next action

**Example (LinkedIn)**:
```
Status meetings are the #1 time waster in product development.

Most teams spend 10+ hours/week just syncing on what's happening.

The solution? Real-time project dashboards that make status meetings 
unnecessary. [Customer] cut sync time from 2 hours/day to 30 min/week.

Curious how they did it? [link]
```

**Key principle**: One idea, make it scannable. Visual + stat performs best.

#### 6. Display Ad (Low-context, interruptive)

**Structure**:
- Headline: Outcome or stat
- Subhead (optional): One-line how
- Visual: Product screenshot or metaphor
- CTA: Clear action

**Example**:
```
[Headline]
Ship products 40% faster

[Subhead]
Real-time collaboration for product teams

[CTA Button]
See how
```

**Key principle**: Visual + outcome + CTA. No room for multiple messages.

#### 7. In-Product Messaging (Low-context, task-focused)

**Structure**:
- What: One-line feature description
- Why: One-line benefit
- CTA: Try it or learn more

**Example (Tooltip)**:
```
[Feature Name] 
Automatically assign tasks based on team capacity.

Eliminate bottlenecks and balance workload across your team.

[Enable] [Learn more]
```

**Key principle**: Feature-level messaging (not pillar-level). Just enough context to act.

## Maintaining Consistency

### Messaging House Structure

A "messaging house" is a single-page framework that shows how all your messaging fits together.

**Components**:
1. **Roof**: Brand promise or tagline
2. **Attic**: Positioning statement
3. **Pillars**: 3-5 core messaging pillars
4. **Foundation**: Proof points and supporting evidence

**Why it works**:
- One visual that everyone can reference
- Shows hierarchy clearly
- Easy to adapt for presentations
- Fits on one page

**Create it once, use it everywhere**: Homepage, sales decks, pitch decks, product marketing briefs, campaign briefs.

### Messaging Guidelines Document

Beyond the messaging house, create a reference doc with:

**Core messaging**:
- Positioning statement
- Pillar descriptions with proof points
- Boilerplate (short, medium, long versions)

**Do's and don'ts**:
- Language to use/avoid
- Terminology standards
- Voice and tone

**Channel templates**:
- Homepage template
- Email template
- Social post template
- Ad template

**Examples**:
- Good examples from each channel
- Bad examples (what not to do)

**Approval process**:
- Who reviews what
- When to deviate from messaging
- How to propose updates

### Governance

**Who owns messaging?**
- Product Marketing owns core messaging and updates
- Content/Brand ensures consistency in execution
- Sales enablement adapts for selling
- Product adapts for in-product

**Review cadence**:
- Quarterly reviews: Are pillars still relevant?
- After major releases: Do we need new pillars?
- Annual strategy reviews: Positioning + messaging alignment

**Update process**:
1. Product Marketing proposes changes
2. Review with stakeholders (Sales, CS, Product, Marketing)
3. Test new messaging
4. Roll out updated messaging with training
5. Update all materials

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Too many pillars**: More than 5 means you're not making choices. Prioritize.

2. **Pillars are just features**: Pillars should be benefits/outcomes, not features. Features are proof points.
   - Bad pillar: "API Integrations"
   - Good pillar: "Connect Your Tools" with integrations as a proof point

3. **Inconsistent across channels**: Using completely different messages on homepage vs ads creates confusion.

4. **No adaptation for personas**: Same message for technical user and executive doesn't work for anyone.

5. **Letting messaging drift**: Without governance, every team invents their own version over time.

6. **Forgetting to update**: Market changes, competitors move, features ship. Messaging needs to evolve.

7. **No examples**: Guidelines without examples lead to inconsistent interpretation.

## Next Steps

After defining your message architecture:

1. **Test clarity**: Can someone unfamiliar understand it?
2. **Train teams**: Make sure everyone knows the structure
3. **Create examples**: Show what good looks like in each channel
4. **Set up governance**: Define review process and ownership
5. **Roll out gradually**: Start with high-impact channels first
6. **Measure effectiveness**: Track which messages resonate
