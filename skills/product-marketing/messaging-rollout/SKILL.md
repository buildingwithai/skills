# Messaging Rollout

Test messaging, enable sales teams, and launch campaigns with confidence.

**✨ FOCUS**: Tactical messaging and sales enablement - how to communicate positioning across all channels.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Test messaging** with target audience (headlines, value props, campaign copy)
- **Create sales enablement** (decks, battlecards, email templates, talk tracks)
- **Train sales and CS teams** on messaging usage
- **Launch messaging campaigns** (website, ads, content, outreach)
- **Measure messaging performance** (clarity, conversion, engagement)

**NOT for:**
- Strategic positioning changes (use `positioning-rollout` skill)
- Creating initial messaging (use `messaging` skill first)
- Building positioning foundation (use `positioning` skill first)

## Prerequisites

### Messaging Must Be Complete

You need finalized messaging before rollout:

✅ **Messaging framework** - Pillars, proof points, audience variations
✅ **Positioning foundation** - Clear ICP, differentiation, category
✅ **Proof points** - Customer stories, metrics, evidence
✅ **Team capacity** - Resources for enablement creation and training

**If messaging isn't complete:**
→ Use the `messaging` skill to develop your messaging framework
→ Then return here for rollout and enablement

## The Messaging Rollout Process

Complete timeline from testing to full adoption:

**Timeline:** 3-5 weeks for full messaging rollout

```
TESTING → ENABLEMENT CREATION → TRAINING → LAUNCH → MEASUREMENT
(Week 1)    (Week 1-2)           (Week 2-3)  (Week 3-5)  (Ongoing)
```

## How to Navigate This Skill

### Core Process (Start Here)

**1. `references/core/01-message-testing-platforms.md`**
   - Wynter, UserTesting, Maze platform comparison
   - What to test (headlines, value props, campaigns)
   - Internal testing methods (free/low-cost)
   - Interpreting test results
   - Timeline: 3-5 days (platforms) or 1 week (internal)

**2. `references/core/02-sales-enablement-creation.md`**
   - Sales deck development
   - Battlecard creation
   - Email templates and talk tracks
   - Objection handling guides
   - Timeline: 1-2 weeks (can parallelize)

**3. `references/core/03-messaging-training-workshops.md`**

   - CS team messaging alignment
   - Marketing team campaign briefings
   - Facilitation techniques and agendas
   - Timeline: 1-2 weeks

   - Website and owned channel updates
   - Paid campaign launches (ads, sponsored content)
   - Content and email campaign rollout
   - Sales outreach enablement
   - Timeline: 2-3 weeks (phased)

**5. `references/core/05-messaging-performance-measurement.md`**
   - Message clarity and conversion tracking
   - Sales adoption metrics
   - Campaign performance analysis
   - Continuous optimization process
   - Timeline: Ongoing (weekly/monthly reviews)

## Key Principles

### 1. Test Messages Before Scaling

**Don't launch untested messaging:**

**What to test:**
- Homepage hero section (clarity, relevance, value)
- Email subject lines and openers
- Ad headlines and copy
- Value propositions for each persona

**Platforms:**
- Wynter: B2B message testing ($899, 12-48 hours)
- UserTesting: General usability and comprehension
- Internal: Customer interviews, A/B tests

**Target scores:** Clarity 4.0+/5, Relevance 3.5+/5, Value 3.5+/5

### 2. Enablement Drives Adoption

**Training without materials = inconsistent usage:**

**Essential enablement:**
- **Sales deck**: Primary sales tool (15-20 slides)
- **Battlecards**: Competitive differentiation (1 page per competitor)
- **Email templates**: Outreach sequences (5-7 templates)
- **Talk tracks**: Discovery questions, demos, objection handling
- **One-pager**: Messaging house for quick reference

**Make new messaging easier to use than old messaging.**

### 3. Train for Understanding, Not Memorization

**Effective training focuses on WHY, not just WHAT:**

**Workshop structure:**
- Why messaging changed (context)
- How to use messaging (application)
- Practice using messaging (role-play)
- Q&A and iteration

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Lecture-style training
- ❌ "Here's the deck, good luck"
- ❌ No practice or feedback
- ❌ One-and-done training

### 4. Launch is Phased, Not Big-Bang

**Successful launches allow for iteration:**

**Phase 1:** Owned channels (website, blog, social) - Week 1
**Phase 2:** Sales outreach (email, calls) - Week 2
**Phase 3:** Paid campaigns (ads, sponsored) - Week 3
**Phase 4:** Earned media (PR, thought leadership) - Week 4+

**Why phased:** Catch issues early, iterate based on feedback, reduce risk.

### 5. Measure and Optimize Continuously

**Track what matters:**

**Leading indicators:**
- Message clarity scores (Wynter tests)
- Sales team adoption rate (% using new messaging)
- Email open/reply rates

**Lagging indicators:**
- Conversion rates (MQL→SQL, SQL→Opp)
- Win rates
- Sales cycle length

**Review weekly for campaigns, monthly for overall messaging.**

## Typical Timeline

| Activity | Duration | Can Compress? |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Message testing (Wynter) | 3-5 days | ✓ Yes (12-48 hour results) |
| Enablement creation | 1-2 weeks | ⚠️ Can compress to 1 week (quality risk) |
| Team training workshops | 1-2 weeks | ⚠️ Can compress to 3 days (adoption risk) |
| Campaign launch (phased) | 2-3 weeks | ⚠️ Not below 1 week (too risky) |
| **Total** | **3-5 weeks** | **Absolute minimum: 2 weeks** |

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Skipping message testing** → Launch confusing messages, waste ad spend
2. **Training without enablement** → Teams can't apply messaging consistently
3. **One-and-done training** → Messaging fades, teams revert to old habits
4. **Big-bang launch** → No room for iteration, high risk
5. **No performance tracking** → Can't prove messaging works or identify problems
6. **Not involving sales early** → Sales reject messaging, don't use it
7. **Perfection paralysis** → Waiting for perfect messaging vs shipping good messaging
