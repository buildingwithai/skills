**Feedback questions:**

- What's missing?
- How is this different from other personas?

### For Each Persona: Mark Assumptions to Validate

```
PERSONA: ____________________________

ASSUMPTIONS TO VALIDATE:
□ Do they actually have this pain? (HOW: Interview 5 customers)
□ Is this how they evaluate solutions? (HOW: Interview + survey)
□ Do they use these information sources? (HOW: Analytics)
□ Are these the right decision criteria? (HOW: Interview closed-won)
□ Other: ____________________________
```

### Create Validation Plan

## Facilitator Tips

**Energy management:**
- Take 10-min break after clustering
- Keep build-out sessions timeboxed (max 90 min)
- End on time (people lose focus after 3 hours)

**Handling challenges:**
- **HiPPO dominating:** "Let's hear from others first"
- **Disagreement:** "Let's mark as assumption to validate"
- **Too detailed:** "We'll validate with customers, keep moving"
- **Off track:** "Let's parking lot that and stay focused"

---

## Remember

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Proto-personas are assumptions, not facts!

You MUST validate with customer interviews within 4 weeks or these will mislead your strategy.

Schedule interviews before leaving the workshop.
