**Greeting & Context:**

```
"Hi [Name]! Thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me today. I really appreciate it.

I'm doing research on how [PERSONA TYPE - e.g., 'Sales Managers'] make decisions about [CATEGORY - e.g., 'sales productivity tools']. I want to learn from your experience—there are no right or wrong answers, just your honest perspective.

This should take about 30 minutes. I'll ask about your recent experience with [TOPIC], and I'm not selling anything—this is purely research to help us better understand buyer needs.

[If recording] Is it okay if I record this just for my notes? Only I will hear it.

Sound good? Great! Let's start..."

## Tips for Better Interviews

**DO:**
✅ Let them tell their story (80% them talking, 20% you asking)
✅ Ask "Why?" and "Tell me more about that"
✅ Capture their exact words (use their language, not yours)
✅ Stay curious and follow interesting threads
✅ Take notes on emotions/tone

**DON'T:**
❌ Pitch or defend your product
❌ Ask leading questions ("Don't you think X is important?")
❌ Interrupt their story
❌ Skip follow-ups when something is interesting
❌ Forget to ask about failures/concerns

**After 3-5 interviews:** Review for patterns
**After 10 interviews:** Should see clear patterns emerging
**After 15+ interviews:** Likely reached saturation
