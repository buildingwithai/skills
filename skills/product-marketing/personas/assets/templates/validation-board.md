# Persona Validation Board

> **TEMPLATE:** Track evidence that validates or invalidates each persona attribute

## How to Use

For each persona, track assumptions and evidence:

| Assumption | Data Source | Evidence | Status |
|------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| [What we think is true] | [How we'll test] | [What data showed] | [✅❌⚠️] |

**Status legend:**
- ✅ **Validated:** Multiple data sources confirm
- ❌ **Rejected:** Data contradicts assumption
- ⚠️ **Uncertain:** Conflicting data or insufficient evidence

2. [Assumption 2] - Validated by [Source]
3. [Assumption 3] - Validated by [Source]

**Action:** Keep in persona, use in messaging

3. [Assumption 3] - Need analytics validation

**Action:** Plan additional research

## Validation Score

Calculate validation confidence:

**Formula:**
```
Validation Score = (# Validated Assumptions) / (Total Assumptions) × 100
```

**Example:**
```
15 validated / 20 total = 75% validation score
```

**Interpretation:**
- **90%+:** High confidence persona
- **75-89%:** Good confidence, minor refinements needed
- **60-74%:** Moderate confidence, needs more validation
- **<60%:** Low confidence, significant research needed

---

## Red Flags 🚩

Watch for these warning signs:

🚩 **Multiple rejected assumptions** (3+) → Persona may be based on wrong target
🚩 **Validation score <60%** → Need major research investment
🚩 **Conflicting data sources** → Dig deeper to understand why
🚩 **No updates in 12+ months** → Persona is stale
🚩 **Zero analytics validation** → Only have stated preferences, not behavior

## Next Steps

Based on validation results:

**If mostly validated (75%+):**
→ Activate persona in campaigns
→ Schedule quarterly reviews
→ Use confidently in messaging

**If mixed results (50-75%):**
→ Focus validation efforts on uncertain areas
→ Conduct additional interviews targeting gaps
→ Hold off on major activation until more confident

**If mostly rejected (<50%):**
→ Revisit persona definition
→ May need to interview different customer segment
→ Consider if persona represents actual vs ideal customer
