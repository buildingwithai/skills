# Common Persona Mistakes

12 critical mistakes that kill persona effectiveness and HOW to avoid them.

## The 12 Deadly Mistakes

### 1. Creating Too Many Personas (>5)

**Why it's bad:**
- Dilutes marketing focus
- Decision paralysis ("Which persona is this for?")
- Impossible to activate effectively
- Resources spread too thin

**Symptoms:**
- 8+ personas gathering dust
- Team can't remember all personas
- No clear prioritization

**Fix:**
- Limit to 3-5 personas maximum
- If B2B: Use 3-persona model (P1/P2/P3)
- Prioritize: Which segments drive 80% of revenue?
- Consolidate similar personas

**Example:**
Before: 12 personas by industry vertical
After: 3 personas by role (User, Manager, Executive) across all verticals

### 2. Making Assumptions Without Customer Research

**Why it's bad:**
- You're guessing what customers care about
- Personas reflect your wishes, not reality
- Messaging misses the mark
- Stakeholders distrust personas

**Symptoms:**
- "We think customers want..."
- No interview quotes in personas
- Sales team says "This isn't who I talk to"

**Fix:**
- Interview 10-30 real customers (5 Rings method)
- Base every persona attribute on data
- If using proto-personas: Validate within 4 weeks
- Document research sources

**Minimum validation:**
- 10 customer interviews OR
- 100-person survey OR
- Analytics segmentation

### 3. Describing Ideal Customers (Not Actual)

**Why it's bad:**
- Personas don't match who actually buys
- Target audience you want, not audience you have
- Wasted marketing targeting wrong people

**Symptoms:**
- Persona matches your dream customer
- Actual customers don't fit persona
- Low conversion from persona campaigns

**Fix:**
- Interview customers you HAVE (not prospects you WANT)
- Include churned customers and closed-lost deals
- Validate: Do 80%+ of customers match persona?

**Test:**
Pull 10 recent customers → Do they match your persona?
If < 7/10 match → Persona is aspirational, not real

### 4. Failing to Update Regularly

**Why it's bad:**
- Markets change
- Competitors change
- Customer needs evolve
- Stale personas lead to irrelevant messaging

**Symptoms:**
- Personas 2+ years old
- Sales says "This used to be true"
- Declining campaign performance

**Fix:**
- **Quarterly reviews:** Check if patterns still hold (2-3 hours)
- **Annual refresh:** New interviews + survey (2-4 weeks)
- **Trigger updates:** Major product launch, market shift, competitor change

**Signs personas are stale:**
🚩 Sales team pushes back
🚩 Conversion rates declining
🚩 Market has shifted
🚩 2+ years since last update

### 5. Not Sharing Across Teams

**Why it's bad:**
- Only marketing knows personas
- Sales doesn't use them
- Product doesn't build for them
- Personas gather dust

**Symptoms:**
- "Marketing's persona thing"
- Sales unaware personas exist
- Product surprised by persona insights

**Fix:**
- Organization-wide rollout (workshops, posters, intranet)
- Sales enablement with personas (one-pagers, talk tracks)
- Product reviews using persona lens
- CS team trained on personas

**Research:**
65% create personas, only 27% use them (Cintell)
→ Activation is as important as creation

### 6. Focusing Only on Demographics

**Why it's bad:**
- Age/title don't predict buying behavior
- Miss motivations and triggers
- Personas feel generic
- Hard to act on

**Symptoms:**
- Persona is mostly age, income, education
- No goals, pains, or motivations
- Could describe anyone in that job

**Fix:**
Go deeper into:
- **Psychographics:** Values, motivations, beliefs
- **Behaviors:** How they research, decide, buy
- **Triggers:** What made them start looking (Ring 1)
- **Success factors:** What outcomes they seek (Ring 2)
- **Barriers:** What makes them hesitate (Ring 3)

**Good persona:** "Manager Mary needs to increase team quota from 60% to 85% or risk missing board targets"
**Bad persona:** "35-45 years old, Bachelor's degree, Manager title"

### 7. Skipping Validation

**Why it's bad:**
- Don't know if personas are accurate
- Can't prove value to stakeholders
- No confidence in activation

**Symptoms:**
- Personas based on 2-3 interviews
- No survey or analytics validation
- Leadership skeptical

**Fix:**
Validate with:
- **Surveys:** 100-300 responses confirming patterns
- **Analytics:** Behavioral data supporting segments
- **A/B tests:** Persona messaging performs better
- **Validation board:** Track evidence per assumption

**Minimum:**
10+ interviews + 100-person survey OR analytics segmentation

### 8. Poor Activation & Adoption

**Why it's bad:**
- Personas created but not used
- ROI = $0 if sitting in drawer
- Team reverts to guessing

**Symptoms:**
- Personas launched, then forgotten
- No persona-tagged campaigns
- Sales doesn't reference them

**Fix:**
- **Distribution:** Intranet, workshops, posters
- **Enablement:** Sales one-pagers, talk tracks
- **Systems:** Add persona field to CRM
- **Measurement:** Track persona-specific metrics
- **Reinforcement:** Quarterly refreshers

**Adoption checklist:**
- [ ] Personas in CRM/marketing automation
- [ ] Sales trained on personas
- [ ] Campaign briefs require persona selection
- [ ] Persona-specific metrics tracked
- [ ] Quarterly lunch-and-learns

### 9. Vague Generalities

**Why it's bad:**
- Useless for actual work
- Could describe anyone
- Not actionable

**Bad examples:**
- "Wants to be successful"
- "Cares about ROI"
- "Values quality"
- "Tech-savvy professional"

**Fix:**
Be specific:
- ❌ "Cares about ROI"
- ✅ "Needs 20% productivity increase to justify $50k investment"

- ❌ "Wants to save time"
- ✅ "Currently spends 40% of time on proposals, needs to cut to 10%"

**Test:** Could this describe a different persona?
If yes → Too vague

### 10. One-Size-Fits-All Messaging

**Why it's bad:**
- Generic message resonates with no one
- Ignores different stakeholder priorities
- Lower conversion rates

**Symptoms:**
- Same pitch deck for all personas
- Same landing page for Users and Executives
- No persona segmentation in campaigns

**Fix:**
Create persona-specific:
- **Landing pages:** Different URL per persona
- **Email sequences:** Separate tracks
- **Sales decks:** Customized per role
- **Ad campaigns:** Targeted messaging

**Example:**
- P1 (User): "Automate proposals in minutes, not days"
- P2 (Manager): "Help your team close 20% more deals"
- P3 (Executive): "Increase revenue 15% by eliminating sales friction"

### 11. No Clear Differentiation

**Why it's bad:**
- Personas are 90% the same
- Don't need multiple personas
- Confusion about which to use

**Symptoms:**
- All personas have similar goals
- Same decision criteria
- Identical buying process

**Fix:**
Each persona should have clearly different:
- **Goals:** User wants ease, Manager wants team results, Executive wants ROI
- **Pains:** Different challenges
- **Decision criteria:** Different must-haves
- **Buying process:** Different influencers, timeline

**Test:**
Swap attributes between personas → Still make sense?
If yes → Not differentiated enough

### 12. Including Irrelevant Details

**Why it's bad:**
- Wastes space
- Distracts from what matters
- Feels forced and fake

**Bad inclusions:**
- Hobbies (unless relevant to buying)
- Family life (unless affects decision)
- Car they drive
- Favorite foods

**Fix:**
Only include details that affect:
- **What they buy**
- **Why they buy**
- **How they buy**
- **Where they research**

**Example relevant detail:**
"Attends SaaStr conference" → Relevant (targeting opportunity)
"Likes hiking" → Irrelevant (doesn't affect buying)
