### What NOT to Include

❌ **Avoid these:**
- Fictional backstories unrelated to buying (hobbies, family life—unless relevant)
- Too many demographics (age, education, location—unless it affects buying)
- Vague generalities ("wants to be successful")
- Features you wish they cared about (but don't)
- Information not based on research

## Step-by-Step Creation Process

### Step 1: Synthesize Interview Data (2-3 hours)

**Review your research:**
- Pull out interview synthesis by Ring
- Identify patterns across interviews
- Note frequency of different insights
- Separate by persona type if you interviewed multiple roles

**Look for segments:**
Do different groups have different patterns?
- By role (User vs Manager vs Executive)
- By company size (SMB vs Enterprise)
- By use case (Sales vs Marketing)

**Decide how many personas:** (See section below)

### Step 2: Create Rough Persona Outline (1 hour per persona)

**For each persona, draft:**
```
Name: [Memorable name]

Goals (from Ring 2 - Success Factors):
- [Most common goal from interviews]
- [Second most common]
- [Third most common]

Pains (from Ring 1 - Priority Initiative):
- [Most common trigger]
- [Most common challenge]
- [Most common frustration]

Behaviors (from Ring 5 - Buyer's Journey):
- [Where they learn]
- [Who influences them]
- [How they evaluate]

Decision Criteria (from Ring 4):
- [Must-have 1]
- [Must-have 2]
- [Must-have 3]

Objections (from Ring 3 - Perceived Barriers):
- [Most common barrier]
- [Second most common]
- [Third most common]

Quote:
"[Verbatim quote from interview that captures their perspective]"
```

### Step 3: Add Context & Details (30 min per persona)

**Fill in:**
- Company context (industry, size)
- Role specifics (responsibilities, reports to)
- Motivations (what drives them beyond metrics)
- Day in the life (how they spend time)

**Use actual data from interviews:**
- Reference specific interview insights
- Use their language, not yours
- Keep it real, not aspirational

### Step 4: Create Visual/Narrative Version (1 hour per persona)

**Make it come alive:**
- Find a stock photo that represents them (optional)
- Write a short narrative intro (2-3 sentences)
- Format cleanly for sharing

**Example intro:**
```
"Manager Mary is a Sales Manager at a mid-market SaaS company managing
a team of 12 reps. She's under pressure to hit team quota but her reps
are spending too much time on proposals instead of selling. She needs
a solution that her team will actually use without extensive training."
```

### Step 5: Review & Validate (30 min)

**Check:**
- [ ] Based on real interview data (not assumptions)
- [ ] Specific and concrete (not vague generalities)
- [ ] Includes insights from all 5 Rings
- [ ] Actionable (clear what to message, where to reach them)
- [ ] Differentiated (if multiple personas, they should be clearly different)

**Share with:**
- People who conducted interviews (accuracy check)
- Sales team (does this match who they talk to?)
- Customer success (does this ring true?)

### Step 6: Finalize & Document (1 hour)

**Create final versions:**
- One-page persona sheet (visual, shareable)
- Detailed persona document (for deep reference)
- Quick reference summary (for enablement)

**Total time:** 5-8 hours per persona

## B2B 3-Persona Model

For B2B products, focus on exactly **3 personas** representing different roles in the buying committee:

### P1: The User (Primary Beneficiary)

**Who they are:**
- Uses the product daily
- Hands-on experience with the solution
- Often called "end user" or "practitioner"

**What they care about:**
- Does it work?
- Is it easy to use?
- Will it make my job easier?
- How much training required?

**Messaging focus:**
- Features and capabilities
- Usability and workflow
- Time savings
- Ease of adoption

**Example personas:**
- Sales rep (for sales tools)
- Marketing coordinator (for marketing automation)
- Software engineer (for developer tools)
- Customer support agent (for support tools)

### P2: The Manager/Champion (Decision-Maker)

**Who they are:**
- Manages the team that will use the product
- Primary decision-maker or internal champion
- Often initiates the search for a solution
- Sells the solution internally

**What they care about:**
- Will it improve team performance?
- Can I get the team to adopt it?
- What ROI will I see?
- Can I sell this to my boss?
- How does it reflect on me?

**Messaging focus:**
- Team outcomes and productivity
- Adoption and change management
- Management dashboards and visibility
- Business case and ROI
- Political cover (de-risking the decision)

**Example personas:**
- Sales manager (manages sales reps)
- Marketing manager (manages marketing team)
- Engineering manager (manages developers)
- Customer support manager

### P3: The Executive/Economic Buyer (Final Approver)

**Who they are:**
- Final budget approver
- Cares about strategic alignment
- May include functional blockers (Legal, IT, Finance, Security)
- Often signs off but doesn't use the product

**What they care about:**
- What's the ROI?
- What's the risk?
- Does it align with strategic priorities?
- What happens if we don't do this?
- Total cost of ownership?

**Messaging focus:**
- Business impact and financial metrics
- Strategic alignment
- Risk mitigation
- Competitive advantage
- Executive-level proof points (case studies, analyst reports)

**Example personas:**
- VP Sales / CRO (approves sales tools)
- CMO (approves marketing tools)
- CTO / VP Engineering (approves dev tools)
- VP Customer Success

### How to Use the 3-Persona Model

**1. Create separate campaigns for each:**
- Don't try to address all 3 personas with the same message
- Build persona-specific landing pages
- Tailor email campaigns by persona
- Create different sales decks for different personas

**2. Map content to each persona:**
```
P1 (User): Product demos, tutorial videos, use case examples
P2 (Manager): ROI calculators, team adoption guides, management dashboards
P3 (Executive): Business case templates, analyst reports, executive summaries
```

**3. Align sales process:**
```
Discovery → Primarily engage P1 & P2
Evaluation → Arm P2 to sell to P3
Decision → Create materials for P2 to share with P3
Negotiation → Engage P3 directly
```

**4. Identify which persona matters most:**
While all 3 are involved, one is usually the primary decision-maker:
- Product-led growth → P1 often drives decision
- Traditional B2B → P2 is often primary champion
- Enterprise → P3 has final say

```

## How Many Personas to Create

### The Rule: 3-5 Maximum

**Research from HubSpot, Product Marketing Alliance, and practitioners:**
- Keep to **3-5 primary personas**
- More than 5 dilutes marketing efforts
- Causes decision paralysis
- Impossible to activate effectively

### How to Decide:

**Option 1: B2B 3-Persona Model**
If B2B with buying committee:
→ Create 3 personas (P1 User, P2 Manager, P3 Executive)

**Option 2: Segment by Use Case**
If horizontal product with different use cases:
→ Create 1 persona per major use case (max 5)
- Example: Slack has Sales teams, Engineering teams, HR teams

**Option 3: Segment by Company Size**
If SMB and Enterprise have radically different needs:
→ Create 2-4 personas across segments
- SMB User, SMB Manager
- Enterprise User, Enterprise Manager

**Option 4: Segment by Industry**
If vertical-specific value props:
→ Create 1-2 personas per vertical (max 3 verticals = 6 personas max)

### What if you have more than 5 segments?

**Option A: Prioritize**
- Which segments drive 80% of revenue?
- Create personas only for top 3-5

**Option B: Nest sub-personas**
- Create 3-5 primary personas
- Document variants within each

Example:
```
Primary: Sales Manager
  - Variant A: SMB Sales Manager (10-50 people)
  - Variant B: Enterprise Sales Manager (1000+ people)
```

## Combining JTBD with Personas

Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) and personas are complementary frameworks:

**Personas answer: WHO is the customer?**
- Demographics, role, behaviors
- Characteristics of the person

**JTBD answers: WHY do they buy?**
- What job are they hiring your product to do?
- What outcome are they seeking?

### How to Combine:

**Step 1: Use JTBD in interviews**
Ask JTBD-style questions:
- "When you decided to hire [product], what job were you trying to get done?"
- "What were you trying to accomplish?"
- "What does success look like?"

**Step 2: Map jobs to personas**
```
Persona: Sales Manager Mary

Primary Job-to-Be-Done:
"When I need to hit team quota,
I want to reduce time reps spend on proposals,
So they can spend more time selling"

Success criteria:
- Proposals done in 1 day instead of 1 week
- Reps close 20% more deals
- Team hits quota
```

**Step 3: Use JTBD for messaging, personas for targeting**
- **JTBD:** Shapes your value proposition (what job you help with)
- **Personas:** Shapes your targeting and channels (where to reach them)

**Example:**
```
Job: "Reduce proposal time"
Persona: Sales Manager

Message: "Help your team close 20% more deals by automating proposals"
Channel: LinkedIn ads targeting Sales Managers, SaaStr conference
```

## Proto-Personas (Fast Start Method)

**What they are:**
Assumption-based personas created from internal stakeholder knowledge (not customer research)

**When to use:**
- Need personas NOW (no time for 6-10 week research)
- Lean Startup / limited budget
- Need stakeholder alignment quickly
- Better than nothing to start

**Timeline:** 2-4 hours

### Proto-Persona Workshop Process

**Step 1: Invite 6-10 stakeholders (30 min prep)**
Include people who talk to customers:
- Sales (knows buyers)
- Customer Success (knows users)
- Product (knows use cases)
- Marketing (knows positioning)
- Leadership (strategic view)

**Step 2: Individual brainstorm (15 min)**
Each person creates 2-3 proto-personas using template:
```
Name:
Role:
Goals (3):
Pains (3):
How they buy:
Quote (make it up based on customer convos):
```

**Step 3: Share & cluster (30 min)**
- Each person presents their personas (2 min each)
- Group identifies common patterns
- Cluster similar personas together

**Step 4: Consolidate into 3-5 personas (45 min)**
- Team votes on which personas are most important
- Combine overlapping personas
- Fill in template together on whiteboard/Miro
- Debate and align on key attributes

**Step 5: Document & commit to validation (30 min)**
- Finalize 3-5 proto-personas
- Flag assumptions to validate
- **Schedule customer interviews** to validate (within 4 weeks)

**Total time:** 2-4 hours

### Proto-Persona Template

```markdown
# PROTO-PERSONA: [Name]
**Status:** ASSUMPTION-BASED - Needs validation

[Description based on team knowledge]

## Key Assumptions to Validate:
- [ ] Do they actually have this pain?
- [ ] Is this how they evaluate solutions?
- [ ] Do they use these information sources?

## Validation Plan:
- Interview 5-10 customers in this role by [DATE]
- Survey 50+ to test at scale by [DATE]

---
Created: [DATE] in stakeholder workshop
To be validated: [DATE]
```

### Critical: MUST Validate Proto-Personas

**Proto-personas are assumptions, not facts**

You MUST:
- Schedule customer interviews within 4 weeks
- Validate every assumption
- Update personas based on real data
- Replace proto-personas with data-driven personas

**Don't:**
- Treat proto-personas as final
- Skip validation indefinitely
- Build entire strategy on assumptions

## Storytelling & Narrative Techniques

### Make Personas Come Alive

**Bad (data dump):**
```
Name: Sales Manager
Age: 35-45
Education: Bachelor's degree
Goals: Increase quota attainment
Pains: Team missing quota
```

**Good (narrative):**
```
Meet Manager Mary, VP of Sales at a Series B SaaS company.

Mary manages a team of 15 reps who are only hitting 62% of quota.
The board is pressuring her to hit revenue targets, but her reps
are drowning in administrative work—spending 40% of their time on
proposals instead of selling.

She needs a solution that will free up her team's time without
requiring extensive training. Her career depends on hitting this
quarter's number.
```

### Storytelling Techniques

**1. Start with a hook:**
Open with their most relatable pain or aspiration

**2. Use specific details:**
"Managing 15 reps" not "Managing a team"
"62% of quota" not "Below target"

**3. Show stakes:**
What happens if they succeed/fail?
"Her career depends on hitting this quarter's number"

**4. Use their language:**
Pull verbatim quotes from interviews
"Drowning in administrative work"

**5. Create empathy:**
Help reader feel their frustration/pressure/ambition

**6. Include a "day in the life":**
```
Mary's typical Tuesday:
7:00 AM - Review pipeline in Salesforce, worried about month-end
9:00 AM - 1:1s with reps who are behind on quota
11:00 AM - Deal review with CEO (stressful)
2:00 PM - Jumping on sales calls to help close deals
5:00 PM - Approving proposals that should have been automated
8:00 PM - Still on Slack answering team questions
```

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Creating Too Many Personas
**Why it's bad:** Dilutes marketing focus, causes decision paralysis

**Fix:** Limit to 3-5 personas maximum

### ❌ Mistake 2: Describing Your Ideal Customer (Not Your Actual Customer)
**Why it's bad:** Personas don't match reality, messaging misses the mark

**Fix:** Base on customers you HAVE, not customers you WANT

### ❌ Mistake 3: Too Much Demographics, Not Enough Psychographics
**Why it's bad:** Age and education don't predict buying behavior

**Fix:** Focus on goals, pains, motivations, behaviors

### ❌ Mistake 4: Vague Generalities
**Bad:** "Wants to be successful" / "Cares about ROI"

**Fix:** Be specific: "Needs to increase team quota attainment from 60% to 85% to keep her job"

### ❌ Mistake 5: Based on Assumptions, Not Research
**Why it's bad:** You're guessing what customers care about

**Fix:**
- Interview real customers (5 Rings method)
- If using proto-personas, validate within 4 weeks

### ❌ Mistake 6: Including Irrelevant Details
**Bad:** "Drives a Honda Accord, has 2 kids, likes hiking"

**Fix:** Only include details that affect buying behavior

### ❌ Mistake 7: No Clear Differentiation Between Personas
**Why it's bad:** If your personas are 90% the same, you don't need multiple

**Fix:** Each persona should have clearly different:
- Goals
- Pains
- Decision criteria
- Buying process

### ❌ Mistake 8: Forgetting to Update Personas
**Why it's bad:** Market changes, personas become stale

**Fix:** Review quarterly, update annually minimum
