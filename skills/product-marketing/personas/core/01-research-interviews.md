## When to Use This Guide

Use this guide when you need to:
- Conduct customer interviews for persona development
- Understand WHY customers buy (beyond demographics)
- Validate or invalidate assumptions about customers
- Gather qualitative insights for personas
- Uncover buying triggers, barriers, and decision criteria

## The 5 Rings Interview Method

Adele Revella's framework from the Buyer Persona Institute focuses on understanding the buyer's decision, not describing the buyer.

### Ring 1: Priority Initiative
**Goal:** Understand what triggered their search for a solution

**What you're uncovering:**
- What changed that made them start looking?
- What pain became unbearable?
- What event triggered the evaluation?
- What was the "last straw" moment?

**Why it matters:** This tells you how to position your solution and what messaging resonates with prospects in early stages.

### Ring 2: Success Factors
**Goal:** Identify the outcomes they expect

**What you're uncovering:**
- What does success look like to them?
- What tangible results do they need? (Revenue growth, cost reduction, time saved)
- What intangible rewards matter? (Career advancement, peace of mind, status)
- How will they measure success?

**Why it matters:** This shapes your value proposition and proof points.

### Ring 3: Perceived Barriers
**Goal:** Understand their doubts and concerns

**What you're uncovering:**
- What makes them skeptical of your solution?
- What concerns do they have about implementation?
- What worries them about switching from status quo?
- What questions make them hesitate?

**Why it matters:** This identifies objections to handle in marketing and sales.

### Ring 4: Decision Criteria
**Goal:** Learn how they evaluate solutions

**What you're uncovering:**
- What factors matter most in their decision?
- What features are must-haves vs nice-to-haves?
- What do they compare between vendors?
- What's their ideal solution?
- Deal-breakers that eliminate options?

**Why it matters:** This guides product positioning and competitive differentiation.

### Ring 5: Buyer's Journey
**Goal:** Map their evaluation process

**What you're uncovering:**
- Who influences the decision?
- What sources do they trust? (Peers, analysts, reviews, demos)
- How long did evaluation take?
- What sequence of steps did they follow?
- Who had to approve?

**Why it matters:** This informs your content strategy, sales process, and channel selection.

## Step-by-Step Interview Process

### Before the Interview (15-30 min prep)

**Step 1: Select the right interviewee**
- Recent buyer (won deal within 3-6 months)
- Closed-lost prospect (understand why they chose competitor)
- Churned customer (learn what went wrong)

**Step 2: Send calendar invite with context**
```
Subject: Quick chat about your experience with [category]

Hi [Name],

I'm researching how companies like yours evaluate [category] solutions.
Would you be open to a 30-minute conversation about your experience?

I'm not selling anything—purely research to understand buyer needs better.

[Calendar link]

Thanks!
```

**Step 3: Prepare your script**
- Print the 5 Rings question template (see below)
- Review their company background (5 min research)
- Note any specific questions based on their situation

### During the Interview (30 minutes)

**Opening (2-3 min):**
```
"Thanks for joining! I'm researching how [personas] evaluate [category].
I'm going to ask about your recent experience with [our product/category].
There are no right or wrong answers—I just want to understand your perspective.
Is 30 minutes still good? Great, let's dive in."
```

**Main Interview (22-25 min):**
Work through the 5 Rings questions (see Question Bank below).
- Let them tell their story naturally
- Ask follow-ups: "Tell me more about that" / "What happened next?" / "Why was that important?"
- Take notes on exact phrases they use
- Don't pitch or defend your product

**Closing (2-3 min):**
```
"This has been incredibly helpful. Two quick questions:
1. Is there anything else about your buying process I should understand?
2. Would you be open to a quick follow-up if I have clarifying questions?"

Thank you! [Send thank-you gift card if budgeted]
```

### After the Interview (15-20 min)

**Step 1: Write up notes immediately**
While fresh, document:
- Key quotes (verbatim—their language matters)
- Patterns you're seeing across interviews
- Surprising insights
- Questions for next interview

**Step 2: Tag insights by Ring**
Organize notes:
- Ring 1 (Trigger): ___
- Ring 2 (Success): ___
- Ring 3 (Barriers): ___
- Ring 4 (Criteria): ___
- Ring 5 (Journey): ___

**Step 3: Update running synthesis**
After every 3-5 interviews, review:
- What patterns are emerging?
- What's consistent across interviews?
- What's unique to specific segments?

## Who to Interview

### Priority 1: Recent Wins (50% of interviews)
Customers who bought within last 3-6 months

**Why:** Fresh memory, successful outcome, understand what worked
**How to recruit:** Ask account manager or CS for intro
**Focus:** All 5 Rings

### Priority 2: Closed-Lost Deals (30% of interviews)
Prospects who chose competitor or status quo

**Why:** Understand where you lost, competitive gaps
**How to recruit:** Sales team warm intro
**Focus:** Rings 3, 4, 5 (Barriers, Criteria, Journey)

### Priority 3: Churned Customers (20% of interviews)
Former customers who left

**Why:** Identify unmet needs, product gaps
**How to recruit:** CS team intro, offer incentive
**Focus:** Rings 2, 3 (Success factors they didn't get, Barriers that materialized)

### Who else to include:
- **Active evaluators:** Currently in buying process (hard to get but gold)
- **Internal stakeholders:** Sales, CS, account managers (cheaper but biased—use sparingly)

### Who to avoid:
- People who've never bought in the category (no experience)
- Researchers doing market analysis (not real buyers)
- Extremely happy customers only (confirmation bias)

## How Many Interviews

### Adele Revella's Recommendation:
**Start with 30 interviews** (10-30 depending on homogeneity)

### Adjust based on market:

**Homogeneous market (same industry, company size, use case):**
→ 10 interviews may be enough
- Enterprise SaaS selling only to Fortune 500
- Vertical-specific product (e.g., dental practice management)
- Single buyer persona

**Heterogeneous market (multiple segments, diverse needs):**
→ 20-30 interviews needed
- Horizontal SaaS across industries
- Multiple buyer personas (User, Manager, Executive)
- Different company sizes and use cases

### When to stop:
**You've reached saturation when:**
- New interviews aren't surfacing new insights
- You're hearing the same triggers, barriers, criteria
- You can predict what they'll say before they say it

**Usually happens at:**
- 5-7 interviews: Patterns start emerging
- 10-15 interviews: Solid understanding for one segment
- 20-30 interviews: Comprehensive view across segments

## Interview Script Template

Use this 30-minute structure:

### Minutes 0-3: Opening
```
"Hi [Name]! Thanks so much for joining. I really appreciate your time.

I'm doing research on how [personas] make decisions about [category].
I want to learn from your experience—there are no right or wrong answers,
just your honest perspective.

This should take about 30 minutes. I'll ask about your recent experience
evaluating [category], and I'm not selling anything—this is purely research.

Sound good? Great! Let's start..."
```

### Minutes 3-8: Priority Initiative (Ring 1)
```
"Tell me about the moment when you first started thinking about [category] solutions."

[Let them talk. Follow up with:]

```

### Minutes 8-13: Success Factors (Ring 2)
```

```

### Minutes 13-18: Perceived Barriers (Ring 3)
```

```

## Analyzing Interview Data

### Step 1: Transcribe or Take Detailed Notes
**Immediately after each interview:**
- Write up detailed notes (15-20 min)
- Capture exact quotes (use their language, not yours)
- Note tone and emotion (enthusiastic, hesitant, frustrated)

### Step 2: Tag by Ring
**Organize each insight:**
```
[Ring 1 - Trigger]: "We were losing deals because our proposal process took 3 weeks"
[Ring 2 - Success]: "Cut proposal time to 3 days, win 20% more deals"
[Ring 3 - Barrier]: "Worried about getting sales team to adopt new tool"
[Ring 4 - Criteria]: "Must integrate with Salesforce, under $10k/yr"
[Ring 5 - Journey]: "Sales VP heard about us at SaaStr, demoed 3 vendors"
```

### Step 3: Look for Patterns Across Interviews

After 3-5 interviews, start tracking:

**Frequency analysis:**
- What triggers are mentioned repeatedly?
- Which success factors come up most?
- Which barriers are most common?

**Example pattern recognition:**
```
TRIGGER PATTERN (mentioned 8 of 10 interviews):
"Lost a big deal because proposal took too long"

SUCCESS FACTOR PATTERN (mentioned 9 of 10):
"Need to cut proposal time by 50%+"

BARRIER PATTERN (mentioned 7 of 10):
"Sales team resistant to learning new tools"
```

### Step 4: Segment by Persona

**Do patterns differ by role?**
- Users care about X
- Managers care about Y
- Executives care about Z

**Example:**
```
P1 (User - Sales Rep):
- Trigger: "Proposals take forever, I'm losing deals"
- Success: "I can send proposals in minutes, not days"

P2 (Manager - Sales Manager):
- Trigger: "Team hitting only 60% of quota"
- Success: "Team closes 20% more deals"

P3 (Executive - VP Sales):
- Trigger: "Board asking why revenue is flat"
- Success: "Hit revenue target, keep my job"
```

### Step 5: Create Synthesis Document

**After all interviews, compile:**

1. **Key insights by Ring** (with frequency counts)
2. **Verbatim quotes** (best of)
3. **Persona differences** (if applicable)
4. **Unexpected findings**
5. **Recommendations** (what this means for positioning/messaging)

**Format:**
```markdown
# Interview Synthesis: [Persona Name]
**Interviews:** 12 (10 customers, 2 closed-lost)
**Date range:** March 1-20, 2025

## Ring 1: Priority Initiative
Most common trigger (9 of 12): "Lost major deal due to slow proposals"
Quote: "We lost a $500k deal because our proposal took 3 weeks and
       theirs took 3 days." - Sarah, VP Sales

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Only Interviewing Happy Customers
**Why it's bad:** Confirmation bias—you only hear what you want to hear

**Fix:** Interview churned customers and closed-lost deals
- 50% recent wins
- 30% closed-lost
- 20% churned

### ❌ Mistake 2: Leading Questions
**Bad:** "Don't you think our ease of use is important?"
**Good:** "What factors mattered most in your decision?"

**Fix:** Ask open-ended questions, let them tell their story

### ❌ Mistake 3: Pitching During Interviews
**Why it's bad:** Ruins trust, makes them defensive, you learn nothing

**Fix:** Say upfront: "This is research, not a sales call. I want to learn from your experience."

### ❌ Mistake 4: Too Few Interviews
**Why it's bad:** One-off stories, not patterns

**Fix:**
- Minimum 10 interviews per persona
- Continue until saturation (hearing same things)

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not Recording Exact Language
**Why it's bad:** You use YOUR words, not THEIR words in personas

**Fix:**
- Capture verbatim quotes
- Note phrases they repeat
- Use their language in personas and messaging

### ❌ Mistake 6: Only Talking to One Persona
**Why it's bad:** B2B decisions involve 6-20 people

**Fix:** Interview User, Manager, and Executive personas if B2B

### ❌ Mistake 7: Analysis Paralysis
**Why it's bad:** Interviews sit in notes, never synthesized

**Fix:**
- Synthesize after every 3-5 interviews
- Set deadline for final synthesis (1 week after last interview)
- Share findings with team within 2 weeks

### ❌ Mistake 8: Skipping the "Why"
**Why it's bad:** You learn WHAT they did, not WHY

**Fix:** Ask follow-ups:
- "Why was that important?"
- "Tell me more about that."
- "What made you feel that way?"
