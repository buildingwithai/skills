→ Read: core/01-research-interviews.md (mixed methods section)
Best for: Comprehensive understanding
```

**Limited budget + Need depth:**
```
→ Qualitative interviews (10-30 interviews @ 30min)
→ Read: core/01-research-interviews.md (5 Rings method)
Best for: Understanding motivations and decisions
```

**Large user base + Have analytics data:**
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Research is Non-Negotiable
Personas without customer research are called "proto-personas" and must be validated. Interview 5-30 customers minimum depending on market homogeneity.

### 2. Limit to 3-5 Personas
More than 5 personas dilutes marketing efforts and causes decision paralysis. Focus on the most important segments.

### 3. The B2B 3-Persona Model
For B2B products, focus on exactly 3 personas:
- **P1 (User):** Uses the product daily
- **P2 (Manager/Champion):** Makes the decision, sells internally
- **P3 (Executive):** Approves budget, cares about ROI

### 4. Validate with Data, Not Opinions
Use surveys, analytics, A/B tests, and behavioral tracking. Update quarterly or annually minimum.

### 5. Activation is as Important as Creation
65% of companies create personas, only 27% use them. Focus on rollout, enablement, and adoption.

### 6. Use Adele Revella's 5 Rings
The proven framework for buyer interviews:
1. **Priority Initiative:** What triggered the decision?
2. **Success Factors:** What does success look like?
3. **Perceived Barriers:** What concerns do they have?
4. **Decision Criteria:** How do they evaluate solutions?
5. **Buyer's Journey:** Who influences them?

## Timelines Reference

| Activity | Duration | Can compress? |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Proto-persona workshop | 2-4 hours | ⚠️ Not below 2 hours |
| Customer interviews (10-15) | 2-3 weeks | ✓ Yes, to 1 week |
| Survey research | 2-4 weeks | ⚠️ Not below 2 weeks |
| Persona creation | 1-2 weeks | ✓ Yes, to 3-5 days |
| Validation | 1-2 weeks | ✓ Yes, with rapid methods |
| Activation planning | 1-2 weeks | ✓ Yes |
| Organization rollout | 1 week | ⚠️ Not below 3 days |
| **Total (full process)** | **6-10 weeks** | **4 weeks minimum** |

**Fast track:** 2-4 hours (proto-personas, validate later)

## Common Pitfalls (Quick Reference)

1. **Too many personas** → Keep to 3-5 max
2. **Assumption-based** → Interview real customers
3. **Ideal vs actual** → Describe who you HAVE, not who you WANT
4. **Set and forget** → Update quarterly/annually
5. **Marketing-only** → Share with sales, product, CS
6. **Demographics only** → Go deeper: behaviors, motivations
7. **No validation** → Test with data before rollout
8. **Poor activation** → 65% create, 27% use—focus on rollout

## The 5 Rings Interview Framework

Adele Revella's proven method for buyer interviews (10-30 interviews @ 30min):

**Ring 1: Priority Initiative**
→ What triggered the decision to evaluate solutions?

**Ring 2: Success Factors**
→ What tangible/intangible rewards do they expect?

**Ring 3: Perceived Barriers**
→ What concerns make them doubt you can deliver?

**Ring 4: Decision Criteria**
→ What factors matter in evaluating solutions?

**Ring 5: Buyer's Journey**
→ Who influences them? How do they evaluate?

→ Complete guide: `core/01-research-interviews.md`

## B2B 3-Persona Model

**P1 - The User (Primary Beneficiary)**
- Uses solution daily, most hands-on experience
- Cares about: Does it work? Is it easy?
- Message focus: Features, usability, workflow

**P2 - The Manager/Champion (Decision-Maker)**
- Oversees team, main decision-maker or internal champion
- Cares about: Will it improve team performance?
- Message focus: Team outcomes, management benefits

**P3 - The Executive (Economic Buyer)**
- Final approver, controls budget, includes blockers (Legal, IT, Finance)
- Cares about: ROI? Risk? Strategic alignment?
- Message focus: Business impact, financial metrics

**Strategy:** Create separate campaigns for each—don't use same message for all three.
