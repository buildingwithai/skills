# B2B Buying Committees

HOW to map and influence enterprise buying committees with multiple stakeholders.

## The B2B Buying Challenge

**Research:** B2B deals now involve 6.8 to 20 people on average

**The problem:**
- Multiple decision-makers with conflicting priorities
- Longer sales cycles
- More complex consensus-building
- Higher risk of stalled deals

## Common Buying Committee Roles

### 1. Champion
**Who:** Internal advocate for your solution
**What they do:** Sell your solution internally
**How to enable:** Give them ammunition (ROI calc, exec summary, comparison matrix)

### 2. Economic Buyer
**Who:** Final budget approver (VP, C-level)
**What they care about:** ROI, strategic fit, risk
**How to reach:** Business case, analyst reports, exec briefings

### 3. Decision-Maker
**Who:** Primary evaluator (often Manager/Director)
**What they care about:** Solving their problem, team adoption
**How to win:** Demo value, prove ease of implementation

### 4. End User
**Who:** Daily user of product
**What they care about:** Does it work? Is it easy?
**How to win:** Product demos, trial/POC

### 5. Technical Buyer
**Who:** IT/Security evaluating technical fit
**What they care about:** Security, integrations, architecture
**How to win:** Technical docs, security reviews, API docs

### 6. Blocker
**Who:** Legal, Finance, Procurement, Security
**What they do:** Can kill deal if requirements not met
**How to handle:** Proactively address their concerns early

## Enterprise Personas vs Individual Personas

**Individual persona:** Describes a person (Sales Manager Mary)
**Enterprise persona:** Describes the company's needs and context

**Why it matters:**
B2B buyers don't buy for themselves—they buy for the organization

**Example:**
"Mid-market SaaS companies (100-500 employees) experiencing rapid growth (50%+ YoY) where sales team productivity is bottleneck to revenue goals"

## Mapping Your Buying Committee

### Step 1: Identify Roles Involved

Ask customers:
- "Who was involved in the decision?"
- "Who had to approve?"
- "Who could have killed the deal?"

### Step 2: Understand Each Role's Priorities

**Create matrix:**
| Role | Priority | Concerns | Must-Haves |
|------|----------|----------|------------|
| Champion (Sales Manager) | Team productivity | Adoption risk | Easy to use |
| Economic Buyer (CRO) | Revenue impact | ROI unclear | Proven results |
| Technical Buyer (IT) | Security | Data breach | SOC 2 compliance |

### Step 3: Map Influence Patterns

**Who influences whom?**
- Champion sells to Economic Buyer
- Technical Buyer can block entire deal
- End Users influence Champion

**Critical path:**
End User → Champion → Economic Buyer (with Technical Buyer approval)

## Consensus-Building Strategies

### Problem: Conflicting Objectives

**Gartner research:** 89% of high-regret purchases involved conflicting stakeholder objectives

**Example conflict:**
- Champion wants fast implementation
- IT wants thorough security review
- Finance wants lowest cost
- Users want extensive features

### Solution: Align on Company Objective

**Show how solving the problem helps company-wide goal:**

```
Company goal: Hit $50M ARR this year

How each role contributes:
- Sales Manager: "20% more deals closed helps hit ARR"
- CRO: "Accelerating sales velocity de-risks revenue target"
- IT: "Secure implementation protects customer data and brand"
- Finance: "Investment pays back in 4 months via increased revenue"
```

**Key:** Connect individual priorities to shared company goal

## Persona-Based Account Strategy

### Identify Your Entry Point

**Product-led growth:** Start with End User (P1)
**Traditional B2B:** Start with Champion (P2)
**Enterprise:** May need to start with Economic Buyer (P3)

### Sequenced Engagement

**Phase 1:** Engage primary persona (usually P2 Champion)
**Phase 2:** Arm Champion to sell to P3 (Economic Buyer)
**Phase 3:** Provide materials for P1 (End User evaluation)
**Phase 4:** Address P4 (Blockers - IT, Legal, Security)

### Multi-Threading

**Don't rely on single champion:**
- Build relationships with 3-4 stakeholders
- Understand each person's priorities
- Provide persona-specific value

## Tools for Buying Committees

### Champion Enablement Toolkit

**Provide:**
- Executive summary (for their boss)
- ROI calculator (business case)
- Comparison matrix (vs competitors)
- Case studies (proof)
- FAQ (objection handling)
- Email templates (to send internally)

### Executive Briefing Deck

**For Economic Buyer (10 slides max):**
1. Business challenge
2. Cost of status quo
3. Your solution (high-level)
4. Business outcomes
5. ROI
6. Risk mitigation
7. Timeline
8. Next steps

### Technical Validation Pack

**For IT/Security:**
- Security whitepaper
- SOC 2 / compliance certs
- Integration documentation
- Architecture diagrams
- Reference calls with IT from similar companies

❌ **Only talking to one person**
✅ **Fix:** Multi-thread - engage 3-4 stakeholders

❌ **Same pitch for everyone**
