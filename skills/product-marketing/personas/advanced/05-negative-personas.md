# Negative Personas (Exclusionary Personas)

HOW to define who NOT to target for better resource allocation.

## What Are Negative Personas?

**Definition:** Semi-fictional representations of who you DON'T want as customers

**Also called:**
- Exclusionary personas
- Anti-personas

**Purpose:** Prevent wasting resources on wrong-fit customers

## Why Negative Personas Matter

### The Cost of Wrong Customers

**High CAC, low LTV:**
- Expensive to acquire
- Don't stick around
- Require excessive support
- Drag down metrics

**Resource drain:**
- Sales time wasted on unqualified leads
- Support overwhelmed with non-ideal users
- Product pulled in wrong directions

**Example:**
SaaS company spending $500 to acquire SMB customers who churn in 3 months (LTV: $300) → Losing $200 per customer

### Benefits of Negative Personas

✅ **Resource optimization:** Stop spending on wrong audience
✅ **Improved targeting:** Focus on high-value segments
✅ **Better product fit:** Build for right customers
✅ **Higher retention:** Customers who actually belong
✅ **Clearer positioning:** Define what you're NOT

**Ironic benefit:** Negative personas help you understand ideal personas better

## How to Create Negative Personas

### Step 1: Analyze Churned Customers

- How did they find you?
- Why did they churn?

**Tools:**
- CRM churn analysis
- Support ticket patterns
- Exit interview data

### Step 2: Interview Sales/CS Teams

**Ask:**
- "Who should we NOT spend time on?"
- "What warning signs indicate bad fit?"
- "Who takes the most effort for least return?"

### Step 3: Calculate Customer Profitability

**Segment by:**
- CAC vs LTV
- Support cost per customer
- Churn rate by segment

**Identify negative ROI segments:**
If CAC > LTV → Negative persona

### Step 4: Document Negative Personas

**Template:**
```
Name: Researcher Rachel

Who: Graduate students, competitive researchers, people gathering info

Why they're bad fit:
- No buying intent
- Don't fit ICP
- Waste sales time

How to exclude:

- Sales qualification: "Are you currently evaluating solutions for purchase?"
- Don't advertise on academic sites
```

## Using Negative Personas

### 1. Ad Targeting

**Exclude:**
- Company sizes outside ICP
- Job titles that match negative personas
- Industries you don't serve

**Example Google Ads exclusions:**

- Exclude job titles: intern, researcher

### 2. Sales Qualification

**Add negative persona check:**
```
BANT qualification:
- Budget: Do they have it?
- Authority: Can they decide?
- Need: Do they have the problem?
+ NOT a negative persona: ✓
```

**Disqualify early:**
Save time by identifying bad fit in first 5 minutes

### 3. Content Strategy

**Don't create content that attracts negative personas:**
- Writing for students? Don't, if they're negative persona
- Free tools that attract tire-kickers? Limit access
- Positioning that attracts wrong use case? Refine messaging

### 4. Product Decisions

**Say no to negative persona requests:**
- Feature request from researcher? Low priority
- Use case for wrong segment? Don't build
- Integration for wrong customer type? Decline

## Examples from Real Companies

### Example 3: Developer Tool

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Being too aggressive:** Excluding potential good customers
✅ **Fix:** Focus on clear patterns of bad fit

❌ **Not updating:** Market changes, negative personas change
✅ **Fix:** Review quarterly

❌ **Ignoring data:** Creating negative personas on assumptions
✅ **Fix:** Base on churn data, CAC/LTV analysis

❌ **Not communicating:** Sales doesn't know to exclude
✅ **Fix:** Train teams on negative personas

## Measuring Impact

**Track:**
- % of leads matching negative personas (should decrease)
- CAC for remaining leads (should decrease)
- LTV of new customers (should increase)
- Sales efficiency (more time on qualified leads)
- Customer retention (better fit = better retention)

**Goal:** Improve CAC:LTV ratio by excluding negative personas
