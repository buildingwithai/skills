# Pricing & Packaging

Execute pricing and packaging strategies from research through optimization.

**📊 RESEARCH-BACKED**: Built from 2023-2025 research across Kyle Poyar (OpenView), Elena Verna, Product Marketing Alliance, Simon-Kucher, Paddle, Stripe, and Metronome.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Price new products** - Launch pricing for new products or features
- **Optimize existing pricing** - Improve conversion, ACV, or NRR through pricing changes
- **Choose pricing models** - Select between subscription, usage-based, freemium, or hybrid
- **Design packaging/tiers** - Create good/better/best tier structures
- **Research willingness to pay** - Understand customer price sensitivity and value perception
- **Expand internationally** - Localize pricing for different geographies
- **Run pricing experiments** - A/B test pricing, packaging, or presentation

**NOT for:**
- Positioning (use `positioning` skill - REQUIRED PREREQUISITE)
- Messaging development (use `messaging` skill)
- Product launches (use `product-launch` skill after pricing is set)
- Competitive analysis (use `competitive-intelligence` skill for competitive pricing intel)

**Prerequisites:** Clear positioning required before pricing. You must know who you're for, what makes you different, and your unique value.

## The Pricing Process

**Timeline:** 4-12 weeks (Research 1-3w, Design 2-4w, Test 1-2w, Launch 1w, Optimize ongoing)

```
RESEARCH → DESIGN → PRESENT → LAUNCH → OPTIMIZE
(1-3w)     (2-4w)   (1-2w)    (1w)     (continuous)
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Positioning is the Foundation for Pricing

Cannot price effectively without clear positioning:
- Who you're for (ICP, best-fit customers)
- What makes you different (unique value)
- What alternatives exist (competitive landscape)

**If you don't have positioning:** Use `positioning` skill first, then return here.

**95% of pricing problems are actually positioning problems.** If customers say "too expensive," that's weak positioning, not wrong pricing.

### 2. Pricing is Strategy, Not Just Math

Pricing decisions drive:
- Which customers you attract
- How they use your product
- Revenue growth trajectory
- Competitive positioning

**1% pricing improvement = 11-15% operating profit increase** (more powerful than acquisition or retention improvements).

### 3. Value-Based Pricing Always Wins

Three pricing strategies:
- ❌ **Cost-plus**: Add margin to costs (ignores customer value)
- ⚠️ **Competitor-based**: Match competitors (race to bottom)
- ✅ **Value-based**: Price to customer perceived value (optimal)

**2024 data: 68% of high-growth SaaS use value-based pricing.**

### 4. Iterate Quarterly, Don't "Set and Forget"

Most SaaS spend only 6 hours EVER on pricing (not 6 hours/week, EVER).

**Best practice:**
- Early-stage: Review pricing monthly
- Growth-stage: Review pricing quarterly
- Mature: Review pricing bi-annually

Only 24% of SaaS regularly test pricing. Those who do outperform by 30% NDR.

### 5. Test Everything

Don't guess - experiment:
- A/B test price points
- Test packaging variations
- Test pricing page presentation
- Measure conversion, ACV, NRR impact

**Statistical requirements:** 250-500 visitors per variation, 30-60 days minimum.

### 6. Pricing is Cross-Functional

Pricing impacts:
- **Sales**: Talk tracks, objection handling, deal structure
- **Product**: Feature gating, upgrade prompts, UX
- **Finance**: Revenue recognition, forecasting, billing
- **Customer Success**: Expansion plays, renewal conversations
- **Marketing**: Messaging, positioning, competitive positioning

**Elena Verna's Monetization Council:** Quarterly pricing review with DRI from each function.

## Related Skills

**Prerequisites (complete FIRST):**
1. **`positioning`** - Clear positioning is REQUIRED before pricing (1-2 weeks)
   - Without positioning, you can't understand your value or differentiation
   - Pricing problems are usually positioning problems in disguise

**Helpful but not blocking:**
- **`messaging`** - Helps with pricing messaging and value communication (2-3 weeks)
- **`competitive-intelligence`** - Deep competitive pricing analysis

**Next steps after pricing:**
- **`product-launch`** - Launch products with pricing strategy (4-8 weeks)
- **`sales-enablement`** - Enable sales team on pricing, value, negotiation

**Complementary:**
- **`personas`** - Buyer intelligence for tier design and WTP research
- **`rollout-and-launch`** - Internal rollout of new pricing

## Integration Workflow

```
Step 1: POSITIONING (positioning skill) → 1-2 weeks [REQUIRED]
Step 2: PRICING RESEARCH (this skill, core 1-3) → 1-3 weeks
Step 3: PRICING DESIGN (this skill, core 4-8) → 2-4 weeks
Step 4: PRICING TESTING (this skill, core 9) → 1-2 weeks
Step 5: PRICING LAUNCH (this skill, core 10-11) → 1 week
Step 6: OPTIMIZATION (this skill, core 12) → Ongoing
```

**Parallel workflow option:** Can do `messaging` skill in parallel with pricing design (weeks 4-6).

## Typical Timelines

| Activity | Timeline | Minimum |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Research & Analysis | 2-4 weeks | 1-2 weeks |
| Pricing Model Design | 2-3 weeks | 1 week |
| Testing & Validation | 1-2 weeks | 3-5 days |
| Launch & Implementation | 1 week | N/A |
| **Total (new pricing)** | **6-10 weeks** | **3-5 weeks** |

**Optimization cycles:** 1-2 weeks per experiment, run quarterly.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Skipping positioning** → Cannot price without knowing your value and differentiation
2. **Underpricing from fear** → Most common founder mistake, attracts wrong customers
3. **Wrong value metric** → 8/10 companies using per-user should use different metric
4. **Never testing** → Only 24% test regularly, missing 30% NDR improvement
5. **Over-complex packaging** → >4 tiers = decision paralysis
6. **"Set and forget"** → Average SaaS spends only 6 hours EVER on pricing
7. **No WTP research** → Guessing customer willingness to pay vs researching it
8. **Hiding pricing** → "Contact sales" kills SMB conversion
