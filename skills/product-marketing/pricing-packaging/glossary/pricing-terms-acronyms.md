# Pricing Terms & Acronyms

Comprehensive glossary of pricing terminology.

## A

**ACV (Annual Contract Value)**
- Total value of a contract per year
- Formula: Total contract value / Number of years
- Example: $60K for 3-year contract = $20K ACV
- Use: Measure deal size, forecast revenue

**Anchoring**
- Psychological pricing tactic
- First price seen influences perception of subsequent prices
- Example: Show $999 tier first, makes $499 seem cheap
- Related: Pricing psychology

**ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**
- Average revenue generated per customer
- Formula: Total revenue / Number of customers
- Example: $100K revenue / 1,000 customers = $100 ARPU
- Also: ARPA (Average Revenue Per Account)

## B

**Billing Cadence**
- How often customers are charged
- Options: Monthly, quarterly, annually, usage-based
- Impact: Annual = better cash flow, lower churn

**Bundle**
- Multiple products/features sold together
- Example: Email + CRM + Analytics for $149/month
- Benefit: Higher ACV, convenience
- Related: Unbundling

---

## C

**CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**
- Cost to acquire one customer
- Formula: Sales & marketing spend / New customers acquired
- Example: $100K spend / 100 customers = $1K CAC
- Benchmark: LTV should be 3x+ CAC

**CAC Payback Period**
- Time to recover customer acquisition cost
- Formula: CAC / (MRR × Gross margin)
- Example: $1,200 CAC / ($100 MRR × 80% margin) = 15 months
- Benchmark: 6-12 months for healthy SaaS

**Churn Rate**
- % of customers canceling per period (monthly, annually)
- Formula: (Customers lost / Starting customers) × 100
- Example: Lost 5 of 100 customers = 5% monthly churn
- Benchmark: < 5% monthly for B2B SaaS (good)

**Conjoint Analysis**
- Research method to understand feature/price trade-offs
- Process: Show combinations, ask preferences, calculate value weights
- Use: Determine willingness to pay by feature
- Alternative: Van Westendorp PSM

**Contraction Revenue**
- Revenue lost from downgrades (not cancellations)
- Example: Customer moves from $149 to $99 tier = -$50 contraction
- Related: Expansion revenue, churn

---

## D

**Decoy Effect**
- Pricing tactic using 3rd option to make target option attractive
- Example: $99 Basic (limited), $149 Pro (full) ← Target, $199 Premium (slight improvement)
- Result: Pro seems best value (not too cheap, not too expensive)

**Discount Authority Matrix**
- Who can approve discounts at what levels
- Example: AE 0-10%, Manager 10-20%, VP 20-30%
- Purpose: Prevent over-discounting, maintain margin

---

## E

- Formula: (Upsells + Cross-sells + Usage growth) per month
- Benchmark: 30-40% of total revenue (good)

---

---

## H

**LTV (Lifetime Value)**
- Total revenue expected from customer over their lifetime
- Formula: ARPU × Average customer lifetime (months) × Gross margin

- Benchmark: LTV should be 3x+ CAC

**LTV:CAC Ratio**
- Lifetime value divided by customer acquisition cost
- Formula: LTV / CAC
- Example: $3,000 LTV / $1,000 CAC = 3:1 ratio
- Benchmark: 3:1 minimum, 5:1+ excellent

---

## M

**MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)**
- Predictable revenue per month from subscriptions
- Formula: Sum of all monthly subscription values
- Example: 100 customers × $100/month = $10K MRR
- Related: ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue = MRR × 12)

---

## N

**NRR (Net Revenue Retention)**
- Revenue retention + expansion from existing customers
- Formula: ((Starting MRR + Expansion - Churn - Contraction) / Starting MRR) × 100
- Example: Start $100K, expand +$20K, churn -$10K = $110K / $100K = 110% NRR
- Benchmark: 115-125% for high-growth SaaS (2024)

---

## O

- Use: International/localized pricing

**PQL (Product Qualified Lead)**
- Free user likely to convert (based on behavior)
- Criteria: Activated, high usage, team invite, gated feature click
- Conversion: 20-40% (vs 2-5% all free users)

**Van Westendorp PSM (Price Sensitivity Meter)**
- Research method to determine acceptable price range
- 4 questions: Too cheap, great value, getting expensive, too expensive
- Output: OPP (optimal price point), IPP (indifference price), acceptable range

**Viral Coefficient (k-factor)**
- Number of new users generated per existing user
- Formula: (Invites sent per user) × (% of invites that sign up)
