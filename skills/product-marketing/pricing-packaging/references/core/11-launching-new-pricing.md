## Grandfathering Decisions

**Grandfathering:** Keeping existing customers at old pricing when you raise prices.

### When to Grandfather

**Grandfather if:**
- ✅ Customers <6 months old (recent sign-ups)
- ✅ <10% of customer base (manageable)
- ✅ Price increase >20% (significant, feels fair to grandfather)
- ✅ Early adopters (reward loyalty)

**Duration:**
- 6 months (standard)
- 12 months (large increase)
- Forever (rare, for very early adopters or partners)

---

### When NOT to Grandfather

**Migrate all customers if:**
- ❌ Significant value added (new features justify price)
- ❌ Price increase <10% (small, most won't churn)
- ❌ Need revenue impact immediately (can't afford delay)
- ❌ >50% of customers affected (too complex to maintain two pricing structures)

---

### Partial Grandfathering

**Option:** Grandfather with value-add instead of price freeze

**Example:**
```
"While we're raising prices to $149, existing customers 
at $99 will get:
- Current price ($99) for 6 months
- Then $119/month (discounted vs $149 new price)
- Plus free access to [new feature] (worth $30/month)"
```

**Benefits:**
- Customer feels valued (discount + bonus)
- You still get some revenue increase
- Creates incentive to stay

---

## Handling Churn from Price Changes

### Expected Churn

**Normal churn from price increases:**
- Small increase (<10%): 2-5% churn
- Medium increase (10-20%): 5-10% churn
- Large increase (>20%): 10-20% churn

**Mitigation:**
- Grandfather early adopters (reduces churn)
- Offer annual discount (locks in customers)
- Add value (new features justify price)
- Communicate well (60 days notice, options)

---

### Win-Back Offers

**For customers who cancel due to price:**

**Offer 1:** Discount for 6 months
```
"We understand the price increase is a concern. 
We can offer you $99/month (current price) for 6 more months 
while you evaluate the new features. Does that work?"
```

**Offer 2:** Downgrade to lower tier
```
"If $149 is too high, we have a $79 tier with [core features]. 
That might be a better fit. Want to explore?"
```

**Offer 3:** Annual discount
```
"If you prepay annually, you get 20% off, bringing it to 
$119/month effective ($1,428/year). Does that help?"
```

**Don't:** Offer too-steep discounts that train customers to threaten churn for deals.

## New Pricing Model Launches (vs Price Changes)

**Example:** Moving from per-user to usage-based

### Migration Strategy

**Step 1: Launch new model for new customers first**
- All new sign-ups get usage-based pricing
- Existing customers stay on per-user
- Run for 90 days, validate model works

**Step 2: Offer existing customers option to switch**
- Email: "We have new flexible pricing based on usage. Many customers save money. Want to switch?"
- Incentive: "Switch by [date] and get 20% off for 3 months"
- Self-service: Let them choose (don't force)

**Step 3: Sunset old model (optional)**
- After 6-12 months, announce old model sunsetting
- Give 6 months notice to migrate
- Offer support to help them transition

**Example: Calendly (per-user → per-event-type)**
- Launched new model for new customers (2023)
- Offered existing customers option to switch (incentive: better value)
- Many switched voluntarily (40% in first 3 months)
- Eventually migrated everyone (18 months later)

---

## Rollback Plans (If Launch Fails)

### When to Rollback

**Rollback if:**
- Major technical issues (billing broken, customers charged wrong amounts)
- Massive negative feedback (>50% of feedback is angry)
- Churn spike (>2x normal churn in first week)
- Legal/compliance issue discovered

**Don't rollback for:**
- Some negative feedback (expected)
- A few churns (normal)
- Sales team discomfort (training issue, not pricing issue)

---

### How to Rollback

**Step 1:** Pause (within 24-48 hours if critical)
- Stop new sign-ups at new price
- Revert pricing page to old pricing
- Internal announcement: "Pricing change paused while we address feedback"

**Step 2:** Fix issues
- Refund customers charged incorrectly
- Address technical bugs
- Revise messaging based on feedback

**Step 3:** Re-launch (if fixable)
- Communicate what you fixed
- Re-launch with adjustments
- Apologize for confusion

**Step 4:** Permanent rollback (if not fixable)
- Announce return to old pricing
- Explain what you learned
- Commit to better process next time

**Example:** Unity's 2023 pricing change
- Launched per-install fee (massive backlash)
- Paused within 48 hours
- Revised pricing (removed worst parts)
- Re-launched with apology

---
