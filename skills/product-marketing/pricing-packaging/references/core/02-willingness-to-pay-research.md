# Willingness to Pay Research

Foundation of value-based pricing. You cannot price effectively without understanding what customers are willing to pay.

## Overview

**Willingness to Pay (WTP):** The maximum amount a customer would pay for your product before choosing an alternative or going without.

**Why it matters:**
- Foundation of value-based pricing
- Reveals customer value perception
- Identifies price sensitivity by segment
- Prevents underpricing and overpricing

**Reality check:** Founder intuition is wrong 70%+ of the time on pricing (ProfitWell research). Research beats guessing.

## Three WTP Research Methods

### Method 1: Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter (PSM) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Best for:** New products, price changes, market expansion

**Time required:** 2-3 weeks (design 3 days, field 1-2 weeks, analysis 2-3 days)

**Sample size:** 250-500 respondents (minimum 200)

**Cost:** $2,000-$5,000 for panel, free if using existing list

---

#### The Four Questions

Van Westendorp PSM asks respondents to identify four price points:

1. **Too cheap (quality doubt):** "At what price would you consider the product to be so inexpensive that you would feel the quality couldn't be very good?"

2. **Bargain/Good value:** "At what price would you consider the product to be a bargain—a great buy for the money?"

3. **Getting expensive:** "At what price would you say the product is starting to get expensive, but you still might consider it?"

4. **Too expensive:** "At what price would you consider the product to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it?"

---

#### Analysis & Price Points

Plot cumulative distributions of the four answers to identify:

**1. Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC)**
- Where "too cheap" and "expensive" intersect
- Lower bound of acceptable price range
- Price floor

**2. Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME)**
- Where "too expensive" and "cheap" intersect
- Upper bound of acceptable price range
- Price ceiling

**3. Optimal Price Point (OPP)**
- Where "too cheap" and "too expensive" intersect
- The price at which fewest people reject on price alone
- **Most commonly used as target price**

**4. Indifference Price Point (IPP)**
- Where "cheap" and "expensive" intersect
- Equal number think it's cheap vs expensive
- Alternative target price (higher revenue potential)

---

#### Example Results

Survey of 300 B2B SaaS prospects:

| Price Point | Value | Interpretation |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| PMC | $49/month | Don't price below this (quality concerns) |
| **OPP** | **$149/month** | **Optimal price (fewest reject)** |
| IPP | $199/month | Aggressive price (higher revenue, lower volume) |
| PME | $299/month | Don't price above this (too expensive) |

**Acceptable range:** $49-$299/month
**Recommended price:** $149/month (OPP) or $199/month (IPP if premium positioning)

---

#### Van Westendorp Best Practices

**Survey design:**
- ✅ Show product concept/demo first (they need context)
- ✅ Randomize question order (reduce anchoring)
- ✅ Use realistic price ranges (don't suggest $1 or $10,000 if neither is viable)
- ✅ Segment results (by company size, industry, geography)

**Sample composition:**
- ✅ Match your ICP (decision-makers, not random consumers)
- ✅ Include non-customers (existing customers anchored to current price)
- ✅ Minimum 250 respondents (200 absolute minimum)
- ✅ Oversample key segments for sub-analysis

**Common mistakes:**
- ❌ Asking only existing customers (they're anchored)
- ❌ Sample size too small (<200 = unreliable)
- ❌ Not showing product value first
- ❌ Using for complex enterprise deals (better for SMB/mid-market)

**Tools:**
- Conjointly.com (automated PSM, $500-$2,000)
- Qualtrics (enterprise survey platform)
- SurveyMonkey + Excel (manual calculation)
- Quantilope (automated consumer insights)

---

### Method 2: Conjoint Analysis

**Best for:** Understanding feature vs price trade-offs, packaging decisions

**Time required:** 3-4 weeks (design 1 week, field 1-2 weeks, analysis 1 week)

**Sample size:** 300-500+ respondents (more than PSM for statistical power)

**Cost:** $5,000-$25,000 (complex study with agency)

---

#### How It Works

**Principle:** People make trade-offs between features and price. By presenting choices, we can infer:
- Which features drive most value
- How much each feature is worth
- Optimal price points
- Ideal product configurations

**Example choice set:**

```
Which would you choose?

Option A:
- Basic analytics
- Email support
- $99/month

Option B:
- Advanced analytics
- Priority support
- API access
- $199/month

Option C:
- Basic analytics
- Priority support
- $149/month

[I would choose: ___]
```

Respondents see 8-15 choice sets with varying features and prices. Analysis reveals:
- Feature preference (which features drive choice)
- Price sensitivity (how much price affects choice)
- Willingness to pay for specific features

---

#### Conjoint Types

**1. Choice-Based Conjoint (CBC)** - Most common
- Present 2-4 options per question
- Respondents choose one
- Mimics real buying decision
- **Best for:** SaaS pricing, product config

**2. MaxDiff Scaling**
- Present features, select best and worst
- Ranks feature importance
- **Best for:** Feature prioritization

**3. Adaptive Conjoint**
- Questions adapt based on previous answers
- Fewer questions needed
- **Best for:** Complex products (10+ features)

---

#### Conjoint Best Practices

**Study design:**
- ✅ Limit to 6-8 key features (more = respondent fatigue)
- ✅ Include price as an attribute (3-5 price levels)
- ✅ Realistic feature combinations (don't show impossible combos)
- ✅ Test package concepts, not individual features

**Analysis:**
- Utility scores for each feature
- Price elasticity curves
- Optimal pricing by segment
- Market simulation (predict market share at different prices)

**When conjoint beats Van Westendorp:**
- Complex products with many feature tiers
- B2B with multiple stakeholders
- Packaging/bundling decisions
- Need feature-level WTP

**Common mistakes:**
- ❌ Too many attributes (>8 = unreliable)
- ❌ Hypothetical features (confuses respondents)
- ❌ Sample doesn't match ICP
- ❌ Poor choice set design (dominated options)

**Tools:**
- Sawtooth Software (industry standard, $10K+)
- Conjointly (affordable, $2K-$5K)
- Qualtrics (enterprise)

---

### Method 3: Customer Interviews (Qualitative WTP)

**Best for:** Early-stage products, B2B enterprise, understanding "why" behind WTP

**Time required:** 2-4 weeks (recruit 1 week, interviews 1-2 weeks, analysis 3-5 days)

**Sample size:** 20-40 interviews (qualitative, not statistically significant)

**Cost:** $0-$5,000 (recruiter fees if using panel)

---

#### Interview Structure (45-60 minutes)

**Part 1: Context Setting (10 min)**
- Current solution/workflow
- Pain points and challenges
- Decision-making process
- Budget ownership

**Part 2: Product Demo/Concept (10 min)**
- Show your product or prototype
- Explain key capabilities
- Let them ask questions

**Part 3: Value Discovery (15 min)**
- "What problems does this solve for you?"
- "How much time/money would this save?"
- "What would you compare this to?"
- "What alternatives are you considering?"

**Part 4: Willingness to Pay (15 min)**

**Indirect approaches (better than asking directly):**

**A) Current spend anchor:**
"What do you currently spend on [alternative solution]?"
→ Establishes budget context

**B) Value-based framing:**
"If this saves you $50,000/year, what percentage of that savings would be fair compensation?"
→ Anchors to value created

**C) Bracketing technique:**
"Would you pay $100/month?" → YES
"Would you pay $500/month?" → MAYBE
"Would you pay $1,000/month?" → NO
→ Narrow to range

**D) Feature trade-off:**
"If we removed [expensive feature], would you still pay [price]?"
→ Reveals feature value

**E) Comparison prompt:**
"How does [price] compare to what you'd expect to pay?"
→ Calibrates expectations

**Part 5: Objections & Concerns (10 min)**
- "What concerns do you have about this pricing?"
- "What would make it easier to justify?"
- "Who else needs to approve this purchase?"

---

#### Interview Best Practices

**Recruiting:**
- ✅ Target ICP (decision-makers, budget holders)
- ✅ Mix of industries/company sizes
- ✅ Include people NOT familiar with you (avoid bias)
- ✅ Offer incentive ($100-$200 gift card)

**During interviews:**
- ✅ Record (with permission) and transcribe
- ✅ Ask "why" 5 times (get to root value)
- ✅ Probe for budget/approval process
- ✅ Note exact language they use

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Code transcripts for themes
- ✅ Identify price ranges by segment
- ✅ Extract value drivers (what makes them willing to pay more)
- ✅ Collect objections/concerns

**Common mistakes:**
- ❌ Asking "What would you pay?" directly (unreliable)
- ❌ Selling instead of listening
- ❌ Leading questions ("Don't you think $X is fair?")
- ❌ Only talking to fans (confirmation bias)

## Comparing the Three Methods

| Method | Best For | Time | Cost | Sample Size | Output |
|--------|----------|------|------|-------------|--------|
| **Van Westendorp PSM** | Standard pricing, new products | 2-3 weeks | $2K-$5K | 250-500 | Optimal price range |
| **Conjoint Analysis** | Feature pricing, packaging | 3-4 weeks | $5K-$25K | 300-500+ | Feature value, price elasticity |
| **Customer Interviews** | Early-stage, qualitative | 2-4 weeks | $0-$5K | 20-40 | Value drivers, objections |

**Recommended approach:** Combine methods
1. Start with interviews (understand value drivers)
2. Run Van Westendorp PSM (quantify price range)
3. Optional: Conjoint if complex packaging

---

## Segmenting Willingness to Pay

**Different segments = different WTP:**

### By Company Size (B2B SaaS Example)

| Segment | WTP for CRM | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| SMB (1-50 employees) | $29-$79/user/month | Price-sensitive, self-serve |
| Mid-market (50-500) | $79-$149/user/month | Value features, need ROI |
| Enterprise (500+) | $149-$299/user/month | Custom pricing, volume discounts |

### By Geography (2024 Real Data)

| Region | WTP vs US Baseline | Example |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **United States** | 100% (baseline) | $100/month |
| **Canada** | 136% (+36%) | $136/month |
| **United Kingdom** | 198% (+98%) | $198/month |
| **Denmark** | 251% (+151%) | $251/month |
| **Germany** | 120% (+20%) | $120/month |
| **Southeast Asia** | 60% (-40%) | $60/month |
| **India** | 40% (-60%) | $40/month |

### By Use Case

Same product, different use cases = different WTP:

**Example: Data analytics platform**
- Marketing analytics: $500/month (nice-to-have)
- Financial compliance: $5,000/month (regulatory requirement)
- Fraud detection: $10,000/month (prevents losses)

**Strategy:** Segment pricing by use case, not just by features.

### By Industry Vertical

Some industries pay 2-3x others:

**Example: Scheduling software**
- General business: $29/month
- Healthcare (HIPAA): $99/month (compliance premium)
- Legal (conflict checking): $149/month (risk mitigation)

## Statistical Rigor & Sample Size

### Minimum Sample Sizes

| Research Method | Minimum | Recommended | Ideal |
|----------------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Van Westendorp PSM | 200 | 250-300 | 500+ |
| Conjoint Analysis | 300 | 400-500 | 1000+ |
| Customer Interviews | 15 | 20-30 | 40+ |

**Confidence levels:**
- 200 respondents = ±7% margin of error (95% confidence)
- 300 respondents = ±5.7% margin of error
- 500 respondents = ±4.4% margin of error

**Time to statistical significance (A/B testing):**
- 250-500 visitors per variation
- 30-60 days minimum
- 95% confidence threshold

### Calculating Required Sample Size

**Formula:** n = (Z² × p × (1-p)) / E²

Where:
- Z = 1.96 (for 95% confidence)
- p = 0.5 (maximum variability)
- E = desired margin of error (0.05 for ±5%)

**Example:** For ±5% margin of error at 95% confidence:
n = (1.96² × 0.5 × 0.5) / 0.05² = 384 respondents

**Practical guidance:** Aim for 300+ for Van Westendorp, 400+ for conjoint.

## Common WTP Research Mistakes

### 1. Asking "What Would You Pay?" Directly

**Why it fails:**
- Incentive to lowball
- Hypothetical (not real commitment)
- Lacks context

**Better:** Use indirect methods (bracketing, value-based, current spend anchor)

---

### 2. Only Surveying Existing Customers

**Why it fails:**
- Anchored to current price
- Already bought at old price (different mindset)
- Not representative of broader market

**Better:** Survey prospects, recent evaluators, competitive users

---

### 3. Sample Doesn't Match ICP

**Why it fails:**
- Different segments = different WTP
- Generic "business users" ≠ your buyer persona

**Better:** Strict screening criteria, match ICP demographics

---

### 4. Not Showing Product Value First

**Why it fails:**
- Can't assess WTP without understanding value
- Pricing in vacuum is meaningless

**Better:** Demo/prototype first, then ask about price

---

### 5. Insufficient Sample Size

**Why it fails:**
- <200 respondents = unreliable
- Can't segment with confidence
- High margin of error

**Better:** 250+ for PSM, 400+ for conjoint

---

### 6. Ignoring Qualitative Feedback

**Why it fails:**
- Numbers alone don't explain "why"
- Miss value drivers and objections
- No context for decision-making

**Better:** Combine quantitative (PSM/conjoint) with qualitative (interviews)

---

### 7. One-Time Research, Never Updated

**Why it fails:**
- Market evolves
- Value perception changes
- Competitors shift pricing

**Better:** Repeat WTP research every 6-12 months

---

## WTP Research Timeline

### Week 1: Design & Recruiting
- **Days 1-2:** Design survey/interview questions
- **Days 3-4:** Set up panel or recruit participants
- **Day 5:** Pilot test (10 respondents), refine

### Week 2-3: Fielding
- **Van Westendorp:** 7-14 days in field (depends on response rate)
- **Interviews:** 10-20 interviews over 2 weeks
- **Conjoint:** 10-14 days in field

### Week 4: Analysis & Reporting
- **Days 1-2:** Clean data, code qualitative responses
- **Days 3-4:** Run analysis (PSM charts, conjoint utilities)
- **Day 5:** Create recommendations, present to stakeholders

**Total:** 3-4 weeks from start to insights

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Founder intuition wrong 70%+ of the time** - Research beats guessing
2. **Van Westendorp PSM is the workhorse** - 250+ respondents, 2-3 weeks, identifies optimal price
3. **Conjoint for complex packaging** - Reveals feature-level value
4. **Interviews provide "why"** - Combine with quantitative methods
5. **Segment WTP by company size, geography, use case** - One price doesn't fit all
6. **Minimum 250 respondents** for statistical confidence
7. **Repeat every 6-12 months** - Market evolves, so should your understanding
8. **Never ask "What would you pay?" directly** - Use indirect methods
