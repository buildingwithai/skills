# Pricing Fundamentals & Strategy

**START HERE** - Foundation for all pricing decisions.

## Overview

Pricing is the most powerful lever for profitability and growth, yet most SaaS companies spend only 6 hours EVER on their pricing strategy (not per week, not per month—total).

**Impact:** 1% pricing improvement = 11-15% operating profit increase (more powerful than acquisition or retention improvements).

**2024 Reality:** Only 24% of SaaS companies regularly test pricing. Those who do outperform peers by 30% in Net Revenue Retention (NRR).

## The Three Pricing Strategies

### 1. Cost-Plus Pricing ❌

**Definition:** Add margin to production costs.

**Formula:** (Cost × Margin) + Cost = Price

**Why it fails:**
- Ignores customer value perception
- Penalizes efficiency (lower costs = lower price)
- No relationship to willingness to pay
- Common in manufacturing, rare in SaaS

**When it might work:** High fixed costs, commodity products (rare in software)

**Verdict:** Avoid for SaaS/technology products.

---

### 2. Competitor-Based Pricing ⚠️

**Definition:** Set prices based on competitors' pricing.

**Approach:** Match, undercut, or premium-price vs competitors.

**Why it's risky:**
- Race to the bottom (everyone matching = commoditization)
- Your costs/value may differ significantly
- Assumes competitors priced correctly (often they didn't)
- Difficult to differentiate on value
- Trains customers to shop on price alone

**When it might work:**
- Truly commoditized markets (rare in SaaS)
- Fast-follower strategy in established category
- Temporary tactic while researching WTP

**2024 data:** Companies using competitor-based pricing grow 20-30% slower than value-based pricers.

**Verdict:** Use as reference point, not primary strategy.

---

### 3. Value-Based Pricing ✅

**Definition:** Price based on customer perceived value and willingness to pay.

**Approach:** Research customer value perception → Understand willingness to pay → Price to capture fair share of value created.

**Why it wins:**
- Aligns price with value delivered
- Allows premium pricing for superior products
- Enables price discrimination by segment
- Maximizes revenue potential
- Creates sustainable competitive advantage

**2024 data:** 68% of high-growth SaaS companies use value-based pricing (up from 52% in 2022).

**Requirements:**
- Clear positioning (who you're for, what makes you different)
- Customer research (interviews, surveys, WTP studies)
- Segmentation (different customers = different value)
- Ongoing iteration (value perception changes)

**Verdict:** Optimal strategy for SaaS/technology products.

## Why Pricing Matters More Than You Think

### The Profit Leverage

**Comparison of 1% improvements:**

| Lever | Impact on Operating Profit |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **Price** | **+11.1%** |
| Variable costs | +7.8% |
| Volume | +3.3% |
| Fixed costs | +2.3% |

Source: McKinsey pricing research, validated by OpenView 2024 benchmarks

**Translation:** Raising prices 1% has 4x the profit impact of increasing volume 1%.

### The Growth Accelerator

**Median impact from changing pricing (OpenView 2024):**
- Net Revenue Retention: **+14%** (among expansion-stage software companies)
- Average Contract Value: **+18%**
- Win rate: **+8%** (when pricing aligned to value)

**Companies that changed both pricing AND packaging in 2024:** 50% (up from 35% in 2022)

## Common Pricing Mistakes Founders Make

### 1. Underpricing from Fear

**The mistake:** "If I price too high, no one will buy."

**Reality:** Early-stage SaaS products are "almost always underpriced" (Patrick Campbell, ProfitWell).

**Why it happens:**
- Fear of rejection
- Imposter syndrome
- Misunderstanding competitive landscape
- Focusing on acquisition over monetization

**Consequences:**
- Attracts price-sensitive customers (higher churn)
- Insufficient revenue to fund growth
- Devalues product in market perception
- Hard to raise prices later (customer expectations set)

**Example:** Founder charged $299/month, lost $500K+ enterprise deal because buyer thought product "wasn't good enough" at that price. Raised to $2,999/month, closed 3 enterprise deals in next quarter.

**Fix:** Research willingness to pay, anchor to value created, test higher prices with new customers.

---

### 2. Wrong Value Metric

**The mistake:** Defaulting to per-user pricing when it doesn't align to value.

**Patrick Campbell's rule:** "8 out of 10 companies using per-user pricing should be using a different value metric."

**Why per-user often fails:**
- Discourages product adoption (teams avoid adding users)
- Doesn't scale with value for many products
- Easy to game (shared logins)
- Misaligned incentives (you want adoption, they want to limit users)

**Better alternatives:**
- **Outcome-based:** Results delivered (leads generated, reports created)
- **Usage-based:** API calls, compute time, storage consumed
- **Feature-based:** Access to advanced capabilities
- **Company-size:** Employees, revenue, team count

**Example:** Calendly moved from per-user to per-event-type pricing, 40% increase in ACV.

See `core/05-selecting-value-metrics.md` for detailed guidance.

---

### 3. "Set and Forget" Pricing

**The mistake:** Spending 6 hours on initial pricing, never revisiting.

**Reality:** Market changes, value delivered increases, competitors shift pricing, customer segments evolve.

**Best practice iteration schedule:**

| Stage | Pricing Review Frequency |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Pre-PMF (0-20 customers) | Monthly |
| Early-stage (20-100 customers) | Quarterly |
| Growth-stage (100-1000 customers) | Quarterly |
| Scale-stage (1000+ customers) | Bi-annually |

**Elena Verna's Monetization Council framework:** Quarterly pricing review with DRI from Product, Sales, CS, Finance, Marketing.

---

### 4. Overcomplicated Packaging

**The mistake:** Too many tiers, features, add-ons, variations.

**Red flag:** If pricing page needs FAQ to explain it, it's too complex.

**Optimal complexity:**
- **2-4 tiers** (3 is sweet spot - 60%+ top SaaS use Good/Better/Best)
- **5-8 differentiating features** per tier (not 20)
- **Clear upgrade path** (what's gated, why)

**Example of too complex:** 6 tiers × 15 features × 4 add-ons = 360 combinations = decision paralysis.

**Example of right complexity:** Notion (2024) - Free, Plus, Business, Enterprise (4 tiers, 6 key differentiators)

---

### 5. No Willingness-to-Pay Research

**The mistake:** Guessing what customers will pay instead of researching it.

**Reality:** Founder intuition is wrong 70%+ of the time on pricing (ProfitWell data).

**Research methods:**
- **Van Westendorp PSM:** Survey 250+ prospects, identify optimal price point (see `core/02-willingness-to-pay-research.md`)
- **Customer interviews:** 30+ in-depth conversations
- **Conjoint analysis:** Feature vs price trade-offs
- **A/B testing:** Test price points with real customers

**Time investment:** 2-4 weeks for proper WTP research.

**ROI:** 10-30% improvement in revenue per customer vs guessing.

---

### 6. Cost-Plus Thinking in SaaS

**The mistake:** "Our costs are $X per customer, so we'll charge 3x that."

**Why it fails in SaaS:**
- Marginal cost ≈ $0 for most SaaS
- Value delivered >> costs incurred
- Early customers have higher costs, later customers lower (economies of scale)
- Ignores customer value perception entirely

**Better approach:** Price to value created, manage costs separately.

**Example:** Snowflake's infrastructure costs vary by customer, but they price to value (data processed, queries run), not costs.

---

### 7. Ignoring Price Elasticity by Segment

**The mistake:** One price for all customer segments.

**Reality:** Different segments have different willingness to pay:
- **Enterprise:** Higher WTP, expect volume discounts, annual contracts
- **SMB:** Lower WTP, need transparent pricing, monthly billing
- **Geographic:** Nordics +20-30% vs US, SE Asia -40% vs US (2024 data)
- **Vertical:** Some industries pay 2-3x others for same product

**Solution:** Segment-based pricing, geographic localization, good/better/best tiers.

See `advanced/enterprise-vs-smb-pricing.md` and `advanced/international-localized-pricing.md`.

---

### 8. Hiding Pricing ("Contact Sales")

**The mistake:** Requiring contact for pricing on all plans.

**2024 reality:**
- **SMB buyers:** 73% will not engage if pricing not public (Paddle research)
- **Mid-market:** 58% want transparent pricing
- **Enterprise:** 42% still expect some transparency

**When to hide pricing:**
- True enterprise deals (>$100K ACV, complex procurement)
- Highly variable pricing (usage-based with wide ranges)
- Competitive intelligence concerns (rare)

**When to show pricing:**
- All self-serve tiers
- SMB/mid-market tiers
- Standardized packages

**Best practice:** Show pricing for standard tiers, "Contact sales" for enterprise only.

---

### 9. No Testing/Experimentation

**The mistake:** Never A/B testing pricing, packaging, or presentation.

**2024 data:**
- Only 24% of SaaS regularly test pricing
- Those who test outperform by 30% NRR
- Median time to statistical significance: 30-60 days, 250-500 visitors per variation

**What to test:**
- Price points (±10-20% variations)
- Packaging (feature allocation)
- Presentation (layout, copy, framing)
- Discounting strategies

See `core/09-pricing-experimentation-testing.md`.

---

### 10. Treating Pricing as "Marketing's Problem"

**The mistake:** Assigning pricing solely to marketing/product marketing.

**Reality:** Pricing impacts every function:
- **Product:** Feature gating, upgrade prompts, usage tracking
- **Sales:** Talk tracks, negotiation boundaries, deal desk
- **CS:** Expansion plays, renewal conversations, usage optimization
- **Finance:** Revenue recognition, forecasting, billing systems
- **Marketing:** Messaging, positioning, competitive framing

**Solution:** Cross-functional pricing council (Elena Verna framework)
- **DRI:** Product Marketing or Product Management
- **Members:** PM, Sales leader, CS leader, Finance, Marketing
- **Cadence:** Quarterly reviews, monthly in early-stage
- **Decisions:** Pricing changes, packaging updates, experimentation roadmap

## The Pricing Hierarchy (Patrick Campbell Framework)

Pricing has four levels, in priority order:

### Level 1: Strategy (Highest Impact)

**Question:** Value-based, cost-plus, or competitor-based?

**Decision:** Choose value-based for SaaS (95% of the time).

**Why it matters most:** Foundation for everything else.

---

### Level 2: Model (High Impact)

**Question:** Subscription, usage-based, freemium, hybrid?

**Decision:** Based on product type, customer behavior, value delivery.

**Common models:**
- **Flat-rate subscription:** Simple, predictable ($99/month unlimited)
- **Tiered subscription:** Good/Better/Best (most common)
- **Per-user:** Scales with team size (be cautious - often wrong metric)
- **Usage-based:** Scales with consumption (42% of SaaS have some UBP)
- **Hybrid:** Base subscription + usage overage (38% higher NRR)
- **Freemium:** Free tier + paid upgrades (2-5% conversion avg)

See `core/04-choosing-pricing-model.md`.

---

### Level 3: Packaging (Medium Impact)

**Question:** How many tiers? What features in each?

**Decision:** 3 tiers (Good/Better/Best), 5-8 differentiating features.

**Best practices:**
- Middle tier converts 60-70% (anchor effect)
- Top tier sets value anchor
- Bottom tier qualifies buyers

See `core/06-packaging-tier-design.md`.

---

### Level 4: Page (Lower Impact, Still Matters)

**Question:** How do we present pricing?

**Decision:** Clear comparison table, value-focused copy, social proof.

**A/B testing opportunity:** Layout, messaging, CTA can improve conversion 10-20%.

See `core/08-pricing-page-design.md`.

## When Pricing is Actually a Positioning Problem

**95% of pricing objections are positioning problems in disguise.**

### Symptoms that it's positioning, not pricing:

| Customer Says | Real Problem | Solution |
|---------------|--------------|----------|
| "Too expensive" | Don't understand value | Improve positioning clarity |
| "Can't justify ROI" | Wrong buyer persona | Re-target ICP |
| "Competitor is cheaper" | Commoditized positioning | Strengthen differentiation |
| "Need to think about it" | Unclear category fit | Clarify market context |
| "What makes you different?" | Weak positioning | Use `positioning` skill |

**Test:** If 3+ prospects say "too expensive" without comparing alternatives, you have a positioning problem, not a pricing problem.

**Fix:** Use `positioning` skill before continuing with pricing strategy.

## When to Revisit Pricing

### Triggers for pricing review:

**Product changes:**
- ✅ Major feature release (+20% more value)
- ✅ New product line or platform shift
- ✅ Significant capability improvement

**Market changes:**
- ✅ Competitors raise/lower prices significantly
- ✅ New competitive entrant changes landscape
- ✅ Economic conditions shift (recession, inflation)

**Business changes:**
- ✅ Target customer segment evolves
- ✅ Go-to-market motion changes (PLG → sales-led)
- ✅ Geographic expansion

**Performance changes:**
- ✅ Conversion rate drops >15%
- ✅ Churn increases >10%
- ✅ ACV targets missed 2 quarters in row
- ✅ Win rate declines vs last quarter

**Time-based:**
- ✅ Quarterly for early-stage
- ✅ Bi-annually for growth/scale

**Never triggers (don't change pricing for these alone):**
- ❌ Costs increased (manage costs separately)
- ❌ Need more revenue this quarter (temporary discounting ≠ strategy)
- ❌ Competitor changed price (understand why first)
