# Product-Led Growth Monetization

Optimize pricing for PLG (product-led growth) strategies.

## Overview

**Product-Led Growth (PLG):** Product itself drives acquisition, activation, and expansion (not sales/marketing).

**Characteristics:**
- Self-serve signup (no sales call)
- Free trial or freemium
- In-product upgrade prompts
- Viral/network effects
- Bottom-up adoption (individual → team → company)

**2024 data:**
- 58% of SaaS companies use PLG motion (up from 41% in 2021)
- PLG companies grow 30% faster than sales-led (OpenView 2024)
- Top PLG companies: Slack, Zoom, Notion, Figma, Calendly, Dropbox

## PLG Pricing Requirements

### Must-Haves for PLG Pricing

**1. Free entry point**
- Free tier (freemium) or free trial
- No gated demo, no sales call to start

**2. Self-serve purchase**
- Credit card checkout (instant access)
- No "Contact Sales" for core tiers

**3. Transparent pricing**
- Pricing page shows all prices
- No hidden costs

**4. Intuitive upgrade path**
- Clear differentiation (free vs paid)
- In-product prompts when limits hit

**5. Value-aligned pricing**
- Pay for value received (not arbitrary)
- Scales with customer growth

## PLG Pricing Models

### Model 1: Freemium → Paid Tiers

**Structure:**
- Free: Limited features/usage (forever)
- Paid: Unlock features, scale, support

**Examples:** Slack, Notion, Figma, Canva, Zapier

**Best for:**
- Viral products (network effects)
- Low cost to serve (infrastructure scales cheaply)
- Long consideration (need time to evaluate)

See `advanced/freemium-free-trial-strategies.md`.

---

### Model 2: Free Trial → Paid

**Structure:**
- 14-30 day trial (full access)
- Convert to paid or lose access

**Examples:** Superhuman, Ahrefs, Intercom

**Best for:**
- Quick value realization (days, not months)
- High cost to serve (can't sustain free users)
- Sales-assisted (trial → call → convert)

---

### Model 3: Free Basic → Paid Add-Ons

**Structure:**
- Basic product free forever
- Pay for add-ons (features, integrations, storage)

**Examples:** Mailchimp (free email, pay for automation), Loom (free recording, pay for transcription)

**Best for:**
- Modular products (unbundle features)
- Different customer segments (some need add-ons, some don't)

---

### Model 4: Free Individual → Paid Team

**Structure:**
- Free for individuals
- Pay when you invite team (collaboration = paid)

**Examples:** Figma (free for 3 files, pay for teams), Notion (free personal, pay for teams)

**Best for:**
- Collaboration tools (value = teamwork)
- Bottom-up adoption (individual loves it, brings team)

---

## PLG Conversion Triggers

### Trigger 1: Usage Limit Hit

**Example:**
- Free tier: 100 API calls/month
- User hits 100 calls
- Prompt: "You've reached your limit. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited calls."

**Timing:** Moment of friction (can't continue without upgrade)

**Conversion:** 8-12% convert when hitting hard limit

---

### Trigger 2: Gated Feature Click

**Example:**
- Free tier: Basic dashboards only
- User clicks "Advanced Analytics"
- Prompt: "Advanced Analytics available on Pro plan. [Upgrade]"

**Timing:** Moment of intent (wants feature now)

**Conversion:** 10-15% convert when clicking gated feature (high intent)

---

### Trigger 3: Team Invite

**Example:**
- Free tier: Solo use
- User invites 2nd person
- Prompt: "Collaboration requires Pro plan ($10/user/month). [Upgrade]"

**Timing:** Expansion moment (team > individual)

**Conversion:** 15-20% convert when inviting team

---

### Trigger 4: Time-Based Milestone

**Example:**
- Day 7: "You've created 10 projects! Power users love Pro for unlimited projects."
- Day 30: "You're a heavy user. Upgrade to remove limits and unlock [features]."

**Timing:** After "aha moment" (experienced value)

**Conversion:** 5-10% convert from time-based prompts

---

### Trigger 5: Behavioral Prompt

**Example:**
- User exports data 3x in one week
- Prompt: "Looks like you're exporting a lot. Pro plan includes automated exports. [Learn more]"

**Timing:** After repeated action (behavioral signal)

**Conversion:** 8-12% convert from behavioral prompts

---

## PLG Packaging Strategy

### Freemium Packaging

**Free tier includes:**
- ✅ Core value prop (must deliver real value, not crippled)
- ✅ Limited scale (10 projects, 5 users, 100 API calls)
- ✅ Basic features (90% of features, but simplified)

**Paid tier adds:**
- 💰 Scale (unlimited projects, users, API calls)
- 💰 Advanced features (analytics, automation, integrations)
- 💰 Support (priority, phone, CSM)
- 💰 Security (SSO, SAML, audit logs)

**Example: Notion**
- Free: Personal workspace, 10 guests, basic blocks
- Plus: $10/user/month, unlimited blocks, version history, advanced permissions
- Business: $18/user/month, SSO, advanced security, bulk export
- Enterprise: Custom, dedicated support, SLA, onboarding

**Formula:** Free = "just enough to love it", Paid = "scale & advanced needs"

---

### Good/Better/Best for PLG

**Free (Good):** Individual use, limited scale
**Pro (Better):** Small team, more scale, advanced features (60% choose this)
**Business (Best):** Large team, security, support

**Example: Figma**
- Starter (Free): 3 Figma files, 3 FigJam boards
- Professional: $15/editor/month, unlimited files, version history, advanced features
- Organization: $45/editor/month, design system, SSO, centralized billing
- Enterprise: $75/editor/month, advanced security, dedicated support

**Why 3 paid tiers (+ free):**
- Free: Individual designers (PLG entry)
- Pro: Small design teams (5-10 people)
- Organization: Companies (50-200 people)
- Enterprise: Large orgs (500+ people)

---

## In-Product Monetization UX

### Upgrade Prompts

**Best practices:**

**1. Context-aware**
- Show prompt when relevant (not random)
- Example: Prompt for "Advanced Analytics" when user views dashboard (not when writing doc)

**2. Value-focused**
- Not: "Upgrade to Pro"
- Better: "Unlock advanced analytics to see trends. [Upgrade to Pro]"

**3. Non-intrusive**
- Don't block workflow (modal that forces click)
- Subtle banner or tooltip (can dismiss)

**4. Frequency-capped**
- Max 1-2 prompts per session
- Don't spam (trains users to ignore)

---

### Pricing Page Access

**In-product links:**
- Settings → "Upgrade" button (always visible)
- Usage dashboard → "Upgrade to increase limits"
- Help menu → "View Plans & Pricing"

**Goal:** Easy to find when customer ready (don't hide)

---

### Trial-to-Paid Transition

**14-day trial countdown:**
- Day 10: "Trial ends in 4 days. Upgrade now to keep access."
- Day 14: "Trial ended. [Upgrade] to continue using [Product]."

**Micro-copy:**
- "No credit card required" (trial start)
- "14-day money-back guarantee" (purchase page)

---

## PLG Expansion (Land & Expand)

### Land: Individual User

**Entry:** Free tier or trial
**Profile:** Individual contributor (designer, developer, marketer)
**ACV:** $0-120/year

---

### Expand 1: Small Team

**Trigger:** User invites teammates
**Profile:** 5-10 person team
**ACV:** $500-1,500/year

**Upgrade path:** Individual Pro → Team plan

---

### Expand 2: Department

**Trigger:** Multiple teams within company using product
**Profile:** 20-50 users across teams
**ACV:** $3K-10K/year

**Upgrade path:** Multiple team plans → Organization plan (centralized billing)

---

### Expand 3: Company-Wide

**Trigger:** IT/Security mandates SSO, centralized billing
**Profile:** 100-1,000+ users
**ACV:** $20K-200K+/year

**Upgrade path:** Organization → Enterprise (sales-assisted)

---

### Example: Slack PLG Expansion

**Stage 1: Free team** (1-10 people, 10K messages)
- $0 ACV

**Stage 2: Paid team** (10-50 people, unlimited messages)
- $8/user/month × 20 users = $1,920 ACV

**Stage 3: Multiple teams** (3 teams of 20 = 60 people)
- $8/user/month × 60 users = $5,760 ACV

**Stage 4: Enterprise Grid** (500+ people, SSO, compliance)
- Custom pricing, $50K-500K+ ACV (sales-led)

**Result:** Slack lands free, expands to $100K+ ACV over 2-3 years

---

## PLG Metrics

### 1. Free-to-Paid Conversion

**Formula:** (# of paying customers / # of free signups) × 100

**Benchmark:**
- Freemium: 2-5% (average), 6-8% (good)
- Free trial: 15-25% (average), 30-40% (good)

**Track by:**
- Cohort (Jan signups → % converted by Month 3, 6, 12)
- Channel (organic, paid, referral)
- Segment (SMB, enterprise)

---

### 2. Time to Paid

**Formula:** Median days from signup to first payment

**Benchmark:**
- Freemium: 30-90 days (slow burn)
- Free trial: 7-14 days (fast)

**Optimize:** Reduce time to paid (faster = better cash flow, less churn before pay)

---

### 3. Product Qualified Leads (PQLs)

**Definition:** Free users who match "likely to convert" criteria

**Criteria (example):**
- Activated (completed onboarding)
- Usage (10+ sessions, created 5+ projects)
- Team invite (invited 2+ teammates)
- Gated feature click (tried advanced feature)

**PQL conversion:** 20-40% of PQLs convert vs 2-5% of all free users

**Use:** Sales/CS outreach to PQLs (high intent)

---

### 4. Expansion Revenue (from PLG)

**Formula:** (Expansion MRR / Total MRR) × 100

**Benchmark:** 30-40% of revenue from expansion (good PLG motion)

**Sources:**
- Seat expansion (add more users)
- Tier upgrades (Pro → Business)
- Usage growth (usage-based pricing)

---

### 5. Viral Coefficient (k-factor)

**Formula:** (# of invites sent per user) × (% of invites that sign up)

**Example:**
- Average user invites 3 people
- 20% of invites sign up
- k = 3 × 0.20 = 0.6

**Interpretation:**
- k > 1: Viral growth (every user brings >1 new user)
- k < 1: Not viral (need paid acquisition)

**PLG goal:** Maximize k (product design for sharing/invites)

---

## PLG + Sales-Assist (Hybrid)

### When to Add Sales

**Triggers:**
- PQL reaches high usage (20+ users, $5K+ ACV potential)
- Enterprise domain (e.g., @ibm.com, @walmart.com)
- Manual outreach request (user clicks "Contact Sales")
- Behavior signals (trials SSO, asks about security)

**Sales role:**
- Not gatekeeper (product does acquisition)
- Expansion focus (upsell Pro → Business → Enterprise)
- White-glove (onboarding, training, custom contracts)

---

### PLG-Sales Handoff

**Step 1: Product alerts sales**
- PQL score reaches threshold (80/100)
- Alert: "Acme Corp (50 users, Pro tier) is a PQL. Reach out."

**Step 2: Sales researches**
- Reviews product usage (what features used, how often)
- Identifies expansion opportunities (need SSO? More users?)

**Step 3: Sales reaches out**
- Email: "Hi [name], I noticed your team is loving [Product]. I'd love to show you [Business tier features] that could help with [specific need]."
- Goal: Book call, not close immediately

**Step 4: Discovery & demo**
- Understand pain points, budget, decision process
- Demo Business/Enterprise tier
- Propose custom plan

**Step 5: Close**
- Negotiated pricing (multi-year, custom terms)
- Convert to sales-managed account
