# Freemium & Free Trial Strategies

Design free offerings that convert to paid customers.

## Overview

**Freemium:** Free version available forever (limited features)
**Free trial:** Full product access for limited time (14-30 days)

**2024 data:**
- 71% of SaaS offer freemium or free trial
- Freemium conversion: 2-5% average, 6-8% top performers
- Free trial conversion: 15-25% average, 30-40% top performers

**Key decision:** Freemium vs Free Trial vs Both

## Freemium vs Free Trial Decision Framework

### Choose Freemium If:

✅ **Low marginal cost to serve free users**
- Example: Dropbox (storage is cheap), Slack (messaging is cheap)
- Can sustain millions of free users

✅ **Viral/network effects**
- Free users invite paid users
- Example: Slack (free team invites paying companies), Figma (designers share with stakeholders)

✅ **Long consideration cycle**
- B2B with 3-6 month evaluation
- Need to "live with product" before buying

✅ **PLG motion**
- Bottom-up adoption (individual → team → company)
- Free users become advocates

**Examples:** Slack, Notion, Figma, Canva, Zapier

---

### Choose Free Trial If:

✅ **High cost to serve users**
- Example: Superhuman (onboarding concierge), complex infrastructure
- Can't afford millions of free users

✅ **Quick value realization**
- Users "get it" within days
- Don't need months to evaluate

✅ **Sales-assisted motion**
- Trial → sales call → close
- Example: HubSpot (14-day trial → sales demo → paid)

✅ **Prevent "free riders"**
- Don't want users camping on free forever
- Force conversion decision

**Examples:** HubSpot, Salesforce, Intercom, Ahrefs

---

### Choose Both If:

✅ **Segmentation opportunity**
- Freemium for individuals/small teams
- Free trial for enterprise (full feature evaluation)

**Example: Asana**
- Freemium: Free plan forever (up to 15 users, basic features)
- Free trial: 30-day trial of premium tiers (advanced features)

**Example: Zoom**
- Freemium: 40-minute meetings forever
- Free trial: 30-day trial of paid plans (longer meetings, recording, etc.)

---

## Freemium Strategy

### Freemium Feature Gating

**Core question:** What's free, what's paid?

**Framework: "Core is free, advanced is paid"**

**Free tier includes:**
- ✅ Core value proposition (must deliver real value)
- ✅ Basic use cases (individual use, small teams)
- ✅ Limited scale (10 projects, 5 users, 100 MB storage)

**Paid tier adds:**
- 💰 Advanced features (analytics, integrations, automation)
- 💰 Scale (unlimited, more users, more storage)
- 💰 Support (priority support, phone, CSM)
- 💰 Security/compliance (SSO, SAML, audit logs)

---

### Freemium Models

**Model 1: Feature-limited**
- Free: Basic features
- Paid: Advanced features

**Example: Canva**
- Free: Basic design tools, templates
- Pro: Premium templates, brand kit, background remover

---

**Model 2: Usage-limited**
- Free: Limited usage (10 projects, 100 API calls)
- Paid: Unlimited or higher usage

**Example: Zapier**
- Free: 100 tasks/month, 5 Zaps
- Paid: 750-50K tasks/month, unlimited Zaps

---

**Model 3: Seat-limited**
- Free: 1-2 users
- Paid: 3+ users or unlimited

**Example: Slack**
- Free: Up to 10K messages history, limited integrations
- Pro: Unlimited history, unlimited integrations

---

**Model 4: Time-limited (Hybrid)**
- Free: Basic features forever
- Trial: Advanced features for 14 days → convert or lose

**Example: Notion**
- Free: Personal use, limited blocks
- Trial: 30-day trial of team features → paid

---

### Freemium Conversion Triggers

**What causes free users to upgrade?**

**Trigger 1: Hit usage limit**
- "You've reached 100 API calls. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited."
- **Timing:** When limit hit (in-app prompt)

**Trigger 2: Try gated feature**
- Click "Advanced Analytics" → "Available on Business plan. [Upgrade]"
- **Timing:** Moment of intent (high conversion)

**Trigger 3: Team growth**
- "Invite 6th team member" → "Free plan supports 5 users. Upgrade to Pro."
- **Timing:** Natural expansion moment

**Trigger 4: Time-based nudges**
- Day 7: "You've created 10 projects! Unlock advanced features with Pro."
- Day 30: "You're a power user! Upgrade to remove limits."
- **Timing:** After value realized

**Trigger 5: Comparison with paid users**
- "Pro users create 3x more projects. Upgrade to unlock your potential."
- **Timing:** Ongoing (email campaigns)

---

### Freemium Economics

**Unit economics:**

**Average freemium SaaS:**
- 100K free users
- 2-5% convert to paid (2K-5K paying)
- ARPU: $50-200/month
- Revenue: $100K-1M/month

**Cost structure:**
- Free user cost: $0.50-2/user/month (infrastructure, support)
- Paid user revenue: $50-200/user/month
- Paid users subsidize free users (1 paid user = 25-100 free users)

**Break-even:**
- Need 1-3% conversion to break even (depending on costs)
- 2-5% = profitable
- <1% = unsustainable (shut down free tier or raise conversion)

---

### Improving Freemium Conversion

**Baseline: 2-5% convert**
**Target: 6-8%+ (top performers)**

**Levers:**

**1. Onboarding optimization**
- Get free users to "aha moment" faster
- Example: Slack improved time-to-value from 7 days → 2 hours = +30% conversion

**2. Feature gating optimization**
- Move high-value features to paid (not core)
- A/B test gating (e.g., test "Analytics" in free vs paid)

**3. Upgrade prompts**
- Show value, not just "Upgrade"
- "Unlock advanced analytics to see your growth trends. [Upgrade to Pro]"

**4. Time-to-paid optimization**
- Reduce friction: Self-serve upgrade (no sales call required)
- Example: Add credit card, instant access

**5. Email nurture campaigns**
- Day 3: "Getting started tips"
- Day 7: "You've created 5 projects! Here's what Pro users do..."
- Day 14: "Unlock [feature] to [benefit]"
- Day 30: "Special offer: 20% off first 3 months"

---

## Free Trial Strategy

### Trial Length

**14 days:** Standard for B2B SaaS (most common)
**30 days:** Complex products, longer evaluation
**7 days:** Simple products, quick value realization
**60-90 days:** Enterprise, extensive testing needed

**2024 data:** 14-day trials convert 15-25%, 30-day trials convert 20-30% (longer = higher conversion)

**Trade-off:** Longer trials = higher conversion, but slower sales cycle

---

### Trial Types

**Type 1: No credit card required**
- Sign up with email only
- No friction
- **Pro:** Higher trial starts (+40% vs CC-required)
- **Con:** Lower trial quality (tire-kickers)
- **Conversion:** 10-15%

**Type 2: Credit card required**
- Enter CC upfront, charged after trial
- Higher friction
- **Pro:** Higher intent users (serious buyers)
- **Con:** 40% fewer trial starts
- **Net:** Similar conversions (fewer starts × higher conversion = same paid customers)

**When to use CC-required:**
- High ACV (>$1K/year) - serious buyers only
- Sales-assisted - qualify leads
- Prevent abuse - limit free access

**When to use no-CC:**
- PLG motion - maximize reach
- Low ACV (<$500/year) - friction matters
- Viral - encourage sharing

---

### Trial-to-Paid Conversion

**Average: 15-25% of trials convert to paid**
**Top performers: 30-40%**

**Factors:**

**1. Time to value**
- Faster "aha moment" = higher conversion
- Example: Calendly gets value in 5 minutes (share link, book meeting) = 30% conversion

**2. Onboarding quality**
- Guided setup vs "figure it out yourself"
- Example: Loom's onboarding (record first video in 2 min) = 25% trial conversion

**3. Trial length match**
- Complex product + 7-day trial = not enough time (low conversion)
- Simple product + 30-day trial = forget about it (low urgency)

**4. Sales touchpoints**
- High-touch: Sales call on day 3, 7, 14 = 40% conversion (enterprise)
- Low-touch: Automated emails only = 15% conversion (SMB)

---

### Trial Conversion Tactics

**Tactic 1: Activation milestones**
- Day 1: "Complete setup" (install, connect integrations)
- Day 3: "Invite team" (collaboration = stickiness)
- Day 7: "Achieve [outcome]" (first report, first automation)

**Tracking:** % of trial users hitting each milestone

**Impact:** Users hitting all 3 milestones = 60% conversion vs 10% for those hitting 0

---

**Tactic 2: Upgrade prompts**
- Day 10 (before trial ends): "Your trial ends in 4 days. Upgrade now to keep access."
- Day 14 (trial end): "Trial ended. Upgrade to continue using [Product]."
- Micro-copy: "No credit card required" or "14-day money-back guarantee"

---

**Tactic 3: Limited-time offers**
- "Upgrade during trial and get 20% off first 3 months"
- "Early bird pricing ends when trial expires"

**Impact:** 15-25% higher conversion (urgency works)

---

**Tactic 4: Sales outreach (high ACV)**
- Day 3: Automated email "How's your trial going?"
- Day 7: Sales call "Let me show you [advanced feature]"
- Day 14: "Let's discuss pricing for your team"

**Impact:** Personal touch = 40% conversion (vs 15% self-serve)

---

### Trial Extension Requests

**Scenario:** Customer asks to extend trial

**Options:**

**Option 1: Extend once (standard)**
- "Sure, I'll extend 7 days. This is one-time extension."
- **When:** Legitimate need (vacation, waiting on stakeholder, testing edge case)

**Option 2: Conditional extension**
- "I can extend if you schedule a call with our team to discuss your needs."
- **When:** High ACV, want to qualify

**Option 3: Decline, offer discount**
- "I can't extend, but I can offer 20% off first month if you commit today."
- **When:** Stalling tactic (not serious)

**Don't:** Extend indefinitely (trains customers to ask, never pay)

---

## Freemium + Free Trial (Hybrid)

### Model

**Freemium tier:** Forever free, limited features
**Free trial:** Try paid features for 14-30 days

**Example: Asana**
- Free: 15 users, basic tasks
- Trial: 30-day trial of Premium/Business tiers
- After trial: Revert to free or upgrade to paid

---

### Benefits

1. **Low barrier:** Freemium for individuals
2. **Evaluation path:** Trial for teams/companies
3. **Retention:** Free users don't churn after trial (revert to free)

---

### Challenges

1. **Complexity:** Two conversion funnels (free → paid, trial → paid)
2. **Messaging:** Clear differentiation needed
3. **Economics:** Supporting both free + trial users

---

## Case Studies

### Slack (Freemium)

- 3-5% freemium conversion
- $35B acquisition by Salesforce (2021)

**Why it works:**
- Network effects (free users invite paid teams)
- Hit limit naturally (10K messages = 3-6 months for active team)
- Low cost to serve (messaging infrastructure scales)

---

### Calendly (Freemium)

**Model:**
- Free: 1 event type, basic scheduling
- Paid: $10/user/month (unlimited event types, integrations, workflows)

---

### HubSpot (Free Trial)

**Model:**
- 14-day free trial (full access)
- Sales call during trial
- Convert to paid or lose access
