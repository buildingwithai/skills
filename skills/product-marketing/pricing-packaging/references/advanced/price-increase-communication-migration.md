# Price Increase Communication & Migration

Execute price increases with minimal customer churn.

## Overview

**Reality:** You will raise prices (multiple times as company matures).

**Why raise prices:**
- Product value increased (new features, capabilities)
- Market maturity (willing to pay more)
- Costs increased (inflation, infrastructure)
- Underpriced initially (need margin correction)

**2024 data:**
- 68% of SaaS raised prices in past 2 years
- Expected churn from 10-20% price increase: 5-10%
- Effective communication reduces churn by 30-40%

**Key goal:** Maximize revenue while minimizing churn

## When to Raise Prices

### Good Reasons

✅ **Added significant value**
- Launched major features (10+ in past year)
- Improved performance (2x faster, more reliable)
- Expanded capabilities (new integrations, APIs)

**Example:** "Since you joined, we added [X, Y, Z features] that solve [customer problems]."

---

✅ **Underpriced vs market**
- Competitors charge 2x more
- WTP research shows customers willing to pay more
- You're leaving money on table

**Example:** Calendly raised from $8 → $10/user/month (2023) - market validation

---

✅ **Costs increased**
- Infrastructure (AWS, compute)
- Third-party APIs (OpenAI, Twilio)
- Labor (salaries, benefits)

**Caveat:** Don't lead with "costs increased" (customers don't care) - lead with value added

---

✅ **Need margin for growth**
- Gross margin <70% (unsustainable for SaaS)
- Need funds for R&D, hiring, expansion

---

### Bad Reasons (Don't Raise)

❌ **No value added**
- Product same as 2 years ago
- No new features, improvements

**Impact:** Customers feel "price gouge" → churn

---

❌ **Missed revenue targets**
- "We need more money" ≠ good reason
- Fix product-market fit first

---

❌ **Competitors did it**
- Not sufficient alone (what value are you adding?)

---

## Price Increase Strategies

### Strategy 1: Grandfather (Keep Old Price)

**Model:** Existing customers stay at old price forever (or limited time)

**Example:**
- Old customers: $99/month (forever)
- New customers: $149/month

**Duration options:**
- 6 months (standard)
- 12 months (large increase)
- Forever (early adopters, rare)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Minimal churn (customers feel valued)
- ✅ Rewards loyalty (early adopters benefit)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Complexity (two price points in system)
- ❌ Delayed revenue impact (6-12 months)

**When to use:**
- <10% of customer base (manageable complexity)
- Large increase (>20%)
- Early adopters (first 100-500 customers)

---

### Strategy 2: Universal Increase (Migrate Everyone)

**Model:** All customers (new + existing) pay new price

**Example:**
- Was: $99/month
- Now: $119/month (everyone)

**Notice period:** 30-60 days (minimum 30, ideal 60)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple (one price for everyone)
- ✅ Immediate revenue impact

**Cons:**
- ❌ Higher churn (5-10% expected)

**When to use:**
- Significant value added (justifies increase)
- Small increase (<10%)
- Majority of customers affected (>50%)

---

### Strategy 3: Hybrid (Grandfather + Sunset)

**Model:** Grandfather for limited time, then migrate

**Example:**
- Old customers: $99/month for 6 months
- After 6 months: $119/month (with advance notice)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Softer transition (customers have time to adjust)
- ✅ Revenue impact within 6-12 months

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Two price changes (initial + sunset) - communication complexity

**When to use:**
- Medium increase (10-20%)
- Large customer base (>1,000 customers)

---

### Strategy 4: Value-Add Migration

**Model:** Grandfather at old price + add new features (incentive to stay)

**Example:**
- Old price: $99/month
- New price: $149/month
- Existing customers: $99/month + free access to [new premium feature worth $30]

**Pros:**
- ✅ Customer feels valued (price + bonus)
- ✅ Lower churn (perceived value increase)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Less revenue per customer (discount + feature)

**When to use:**
- High-value customers (enterprises, large accounts)
- Competitive market (retention critical)

## Handling Objections

### Objection 1: "Too expensive, I'll cancel"

**Response:**

```
I understand the increase is a concern. Let me share a few options:

1. Switch to annual billing - locks in a lower effective rate 
   ($X/month instead of $Y)

2. Downgrade to [lower tier] - saves $Z/month, still get core features

3. We can offer current pricing for 3 more months if you need time 
   to budget (one-time extension)

Which of these works best for you?
```

**Goal:** Offer alternatives (not just "pay or leave")

---

### Objection 2: "I haven't seen new features"

**Response:**

```
I hear you. Since [date you joined], we've added:

- [Feature A] which helps you [specific benefit]
- [Feature B] which saves [time/money]
- [Feature C] which [competitive advantage]

These features are now core to [X% of customers] workflows.

I'd love to show you how to use them - can we schedule a quick call?
```

**Goal:** Educate (many customers don't know about new features)

---

### Objection 3: "Competitor X is cheaper"

**Response:**

```
I understand price is important. Here's how we compare to Competitor X:

- We include [A, B, C] that they charge extra for
- Our [unique capability] isn't available anywhere else
- [Social proof]: [Company] switched from Competitor X to us because [reason]

That said, if price is the only factor, we can discuss a custom plan. 
Can we schedule a call to understand your needs?
```

**Goal:** Differentiate (value > price), offer to negotiate (if strategic)

---

### Objection 4: "This feels unfair (new customers pay less)"

**Context:** If grandfathering new customers at *lower* price (rare, but happens)

**Response:**

```
I understand how that feels. Here's the context:

We're running a limited-time promotion for new customers to grow 
our user base. As a loyal customer, you're on our legacy plan which 
includes [X benefit not available to new customers].

If you'd like to switch to the new plan, I can make that happen - 
but you'd lose [legacy benefit]. Let me know what works for you.
```

---

## Retention Offers (Negotiation)

### Offer 1: Temporary Discount

**Customer threatens to churn:**

**Response:**
```
I can offer you current pricing ($99) for 3 more months while you 
evaluate the new features. After that, the new price ($119) applies.

Does that work?
```

**Approval:** CS Manager (case-by-case)

**Goal:** Buy time (customer may realize value, stay at new price)

---

### Offer 2: Annual Lock-In

**Response:**
```
If you prepay annually, I can lock in $109/month (vs $119 monthly) - 
that's $1,308/year instead of $1,428. 

Plus, that rate is guaranteed for the full year.

Does that help?
```

**Goal:** Lock in revenue (annual) + slight discount (still higher than old price)

---

### Offer 3: Downgrade

**Response:**
```
If $119 is too high, we have a [Starter tier] at $79/month with 
core features. You'd lose [advanced features], but keep [core functionality].

Want to explore that?
```

**Goal:** Retain customer (lower tier better than churn)

---

### Don't Over-Discount

**Avoid:** Offering 50% discount to anyone who asks

**Why:** Trains customers to threaten churn for discounts

**Policy:** Max 10-20% discount (case-by-case), requires approval

---

## Expected Churn

### Churn by Increase Amount

**5-10% increase:** 2-5% churn (minor)
**10-20% increase:** 5-10% churn (expected)
**20-30% increase:** 10-15% churn (significant)
**>30% increase:** 15-25% churn (high risk)

**Mitigation:**
- Grandfather early adopters (reduces churn by 30-40%)
- Communicate value (new features, improvements)
- Offer alternatives (annual discount, downgrade)

---

### Acceptable Churn

**Example:**
- 1,000 customers at $99/month = $99K MRR
- Increase to $119/month
- 8% churn (80 customers lost)
- Net: 920 customers × $119 = $109.5K MRR
- **Result:** +10.6% revenue (despite 8% churn)

**Formula:** (1 - churn rate) × (1 + price increase) = net impact
- (1 - 0.08) × (1 + 0.20) = 0.92 × 1.20 = 1.104 = +10.4% revenue

**Acceptable:** If net revenue increases >5%, price increase successful

---

## Case Studies

### Calendly (2023 Price Increase)

**Change:**
- Essentials: $8 → $10/user/month (+25%)
- Professional: $10 → $15/user/month (+50%)

**Communication:**
- 60 days notice
- Email + blog post
- Value messaging (new features: routing, Salesforce integration)

**Results:**
- ~10% churn (expected for 25-50% increase)
- Net revenue +30% (retained 90% × 25-50% increase)

**Why it worked:** Significant value added (enterprise features), communicated well

---

### Superhuman (2020 Price Increase)

**Change:**
- $30/month → $30/month (no change) - BUT stopped grandfathering $20 early adopters
- Early adopters: $20 → $30 (+50%)

**Communication:**
- 90 days notice (longer than standard)
- Personal emails from CEO
- Offered 6-month grandfather extension (for annual commit)

**Results:**
- <5% churn (very low for 50% increase)
- Early adopters felt valued (long notice, CEO communication, extension offer)

**Why it worked:** Personal touch (CEO email), long notice, options (extension)

---

### Netflix (2019 Price Increase)

**Change:**
- Basic: $8 → $9 (+12.5%)
- Standard: $11 → $13 (+18%)
- Premium: $14 → $16 (+14%)

**Communication:**
- 30 days notice
- Email + in-app notification

**Results:**
- ~3% churn (low for consumer product)
- Net revenue +15%

**Why it worked:** Constant content additions (value clear), small incremental increase (not shocking)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **60 days notice minimum** - Respect customers, reduce churn
2. **Lead with value added** - "We added [features]" not "Costs increased"
3. **Offer alternatives** - Annual lock-in, downgrade, temporary extension
4. **Expected churn: 5-10%** - For 10-20% increase (acceptable if net revenue +5%+)
5. **Grandfather early adopters** - Reduces churn 30-40%
6. **Three emails: 60, 30, 7 days** - Avoid surprise
7. **Retention offers: 10-20% discount max** - Don't train bad behavior
