## Churn Prevention Scripts

### When customer threatens to cancel:

**Script:**
```
"I completely understand your concern about the price increase.

Let me share a few options:

1. Switch to annual billing – that gives you [X]% discount and 
   locks in a lower rate for the year. Would that help?

2. We have a [Lower Tier] at $[Price] that includes [core features]. 
   That might be a better fit. Want to explore that?

3. I can offer you your current price for 3 more months while 
   you evaluate the new features. Does that give you time to see 
   the value?

Which of these would work best for you?"
```

---

### When customer questions value:

**Script:**
```
"I hear you. Since you joined, we've added [specific features] 
that [specific benefits].

For example, [Feature A] helps you [save time/make money/etc.]. 
[X]% of our customers use this daily.

Have you tried [specific new feature]? I'd love to show you how 
it can [specific benefit]. Can we schedule a quick call?"
