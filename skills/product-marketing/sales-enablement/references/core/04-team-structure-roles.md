# Team Structure and Roles

Complete guide to building, structuring, and scaling sales enablement teams with clear roles, responsibilities, and growth paths.

## Overview

Sales enablement team structure depends on company size, sales complexity, maturity level, and strategic priorities. There's no one-size-fits-all model, but best practices and patterns exist.

**Key Principles**:
- Start lean, scale based on impact and need
- Define clear roles to avoid overlap and gaps
- Balance generalists (early) with specialists (scale)
- Align reporting structure to maximize collaboration
- Size team appropriately (1:50-100 sales rep ratio at maturity)

## Team Sizing Guidelines

### By Company Stage

**Startup (0-50 employees, <20 sales reps)**
- **Team Size**: 0-1 FTE
- **Model**: Product Marketing or Sales Leader handles enablement "on the side"
- **Focus**: Basic onboarding, essential playbooks, ad hoc training
- **When to hire first enablement person**: When onboarding 5+ reps per quarter or ramp time >6 months

**Growth Stage (50-200 employees, 20-75 sales reps)**
- **Team Size**: 1-3 FTEs
- **Model**: Enablement Manager/Director + Specialist(s)
- **Focus**: Formal onboarding, methodology, content library, ongoing training
- **Structure**: Generalists who can do multiple things

**Scale Stage (200-1000 employees, 75-300 sales reps)**
- **Team Size**: 4-10 FTEs
- **Model**: Director + Managers + Specialists (content, training, ops)
- **Focus**: Specialization, scale, optimization, data-driven programs
- **Structure**: Mix of generalists and specialists

**Enterprise (1000+ employees, 300+ sales reps)**
- **Team Size**: 10-30+ FTEs
- **Model**: VP/Senior Director + Directors + Managers + Specialists
- **Focus**: Global enablement, segmentation (by product/geo/segment), centers of excellence
- **Structure**: Specialized roles, regional teams, advanced capabilities

### By Sales Rep Ratio

**Industry Benchmark**: 1 enablement FTE per 50-100 sales reps (at maturity)

**Calculation**:
- 50 sales reps → 1 enablement FTE (lean, high-leverage)
- 100 sales reps → 1-2 enablement FTEs (typical)
- 200 sales reps → 2-4 enablement FTEs
- 500 sales reps → 5-10 enablement FTEs

**Adjust for**:
- **Higher ratio (more reps per enablement FTE)**: Simple product, short sales cycle, experienced reps, strong technology leverage
- **Lower ratio (fewer reps per enablement FTE)**: Complex product, long sales cycle, high new hire volume, immature enablement

## Next Steps

**After defining team structure**:
1. **Hire first role** → Use interview guide above
2. **Build programs** → Onboarding (`11-sales-onboarding-ramp-up.md`), content (`06-sales-playbooks.md`), training (`13-training-program-design.md`)
3. **Prove ROI** → Track metrics (`18-enablement-metrics-kpis.md`), report results (`19-roi-measurement.md`)
4. **Scale team** → Add specialists as programs mature and impact proven

**Remember**: Start lean and scale based on proven impact. A strong solo enabler with clear charter and stakeholder alignment can achieve more than a large team without strategy. Build your team thoughtfully, hire for fit and impact, and always connect headcount to business outcomes.
