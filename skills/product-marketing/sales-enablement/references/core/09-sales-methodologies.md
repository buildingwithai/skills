# Sales Methodologies

Comprehensive guide to selecting, implementing, and driving adoption of sales methodologies including MEDDIC, SPICED, BANT, Challenger, Solution Selling, and SPIN.

## Overview

Sales methodologies are frameworks that guide how sales teams qualify opportunities, navigate the buying process, and close deals. They provide a shared language, repeatable process, and proven approach to selling.

**Why Methodologies Matter**:
- Provide consistent qualification framework
- Reduce time wasted on unqualified deals
- Increase win rates through disciplined execution
- Enable coaching and performance management
- Create predictability and forecast accuracy

**Impact**:
- **73% of SaaS companies** selling $100K+ ARR use MEDDIC or similar
- **37% win rate increase** with structured qualification frameworks like SPICED
- **49% win rate** on forecasted deals with MEDDIC adoption
- **15-20% improvement** in sales efficiency with proper methodology

## The Major Sales Methodologies

### MEDDIC / MEDDICC / MEDDPICC

**Best For**: Enterprise B2B, complex sales, long cycles (6-18 months), high-value deals ($100K+)

**Adoption**: 73% of SaaS companies selling solutions above $100K ARR

**Origin**: Developed at PTC (Parametric Technology Corporation) in the 1990s

#### The Framework

**MEDDIC**:
- **M**etrics
- **E**conomic Buyer
- **D**ecision Criteria
- **D**ecision Process
- **I**dentify Pain
- **C**hampion

**MEDDICC** adds:
- **C**ompetition

**MEDDPICC** adds:
- **P**aper Process (procurement, legal)

#### Detailed Breakdown

**M - Metrics**
*Quantify the value and impact*

**What it is**: The quantifiable, measurable benefit the prospect will achieve by solving their problem with your solution.

**Key Questions**:
- What specific metrics will improve? (revenue, cost savings, efficiency)
- By how much? (percentage or dollar amount)
- Over what timeframe?
- What's the current baseline?
- How will success be measured?

**Example**:
"By implementing our platform, you'll reduce customer churn from 15% to 10%, saving $2.4M annually. You'll also increase renewal rates from 75% to 85%, generating an additional $1.8M in recurring revenue."

**Why it matters**:
- Economic buyers need ROI justification
- Metrics create urgency and justify budget
- Quantified value helps champion sell internally
- Provides success criteria post-sale

**Sales enablement support needed**:
- ROI calculator tools
- Industry benchmark data
- Value estimation frameworks
- Discovery question banks

---

**E - Economic Buyer**
*Identify who has budget authority*

**What it is**: The person with the authority to spend money and make the final purchasing decision.

**Key Questions**:
- Who owns the budget for this purchase?
- Who must ultimately sign off?
- Have we met with or presented to the economic buyer?
- What are their priorities and success criteria?
- What's their decision-making style?

**Common Mistake**: Confusing the **champion** (your internal advocate) with the **economic buyer** (who signs the contract).

**Example Roles**:
- VP/SVP/C-level in relevant department
- CFO (for large expenditures)
- Business unit leader
- Department head with P&L responsibility

**Red Flags**:
- "I'll take this to my boss" → You haven't identified economic buyer
- Unable to get meeting with decision maker
- Economic buyer not engaged in evaluation

**Sales enablement support needed**:
- Executive engagement playbooks
- Executive presentation templates
- Business case frameworks
- Stakeholder mapping tools

---

**D - Decision Criteria**
*Understand how they'll evaluate solutions*

**What it is**: The specific factors, requirements, and standards the buyer will use to evaluate and compare solutions.

**Key Questions**:
- What criteria will you use to make this decision?
- What must the solution do? (required vs nice-to-have)
- How will you score or rank vendors?
- What's most important? Second most important?
- Who determines the criteria? Can we influence it?

**Strategy**: Shape decision criteria around your strengths and competitors' weaknesses.

**Example**:
If you're strong on integration but weak on pricing, emphasize:
- "How important is seamless integration with your existing stack?"
- "What's the cost of poor integration?" (frame as TCO, not just purchase price)

**Trap-Setting**: Ask questions that expose competitor weaknesses before they present.

**Sales enablement support needed**:
- Competitive differentiation guides
- Trap-setting question frameworks
- Decision criteria templates
- Comparison matrices that favor your solution

---

**D - Decision Process**
*Map the path to a signed contract*

**What it is**: The step-by-step process the organization will follow from evaluation to purchase, including all stakeholders, approvals, and timelines.

**Key Questions**:
- What are the steps from here to signed contract?
- Who's involved at each stage?
- What approvals are required? (technical, security, legal, procurement)
- What's the realistic timeline?
- What could delay or derail the process?
- Have you done purchases like this before? What happened?

**Map out**:
1. Initial evaluation and demos
2. Technical deep dive / proof of concept
3. Security and compliance review
4. Pricing and proposal
5. Executive presentation
6. Contract negotiation
7. Legal review
8. Procurement and purchasing
9. Signature and kickoff

**Common Delays**:
- Security reviews (add 2-4 weeks)
- Legal negotiations (add 2-6 weeks)
- Budget cycle timing (can delay quarters)
- Organizational changes (reorgs, acquisitions)

**Sales enablement support needed**:
- Decision process mapping templates
- Procurement and legal playbooks
- Timeline planning tools
- Stakeholder engagement guides

---

**I - Identify Pain**
*Understand the problem deeply*

**What it is**: The specific, urgent problem or pain point the prospect is experiencing that your solution addresses.

**Key Questions**:
- What problem are you trying to solve?
- Why is this a problem now? (urgency)
- What's the impact if you don't solve it?
- What have you tried so far? Why didn't it work?
- What happens if you do nothing?

**Types of Pain**:
- **Functional**: Process is broken, inefficient, manual
- **Financial**: Losing money, high costs, missed revenue
- **Strategic**: Can't achieve goals, falling behind competitors
- **Personal**: Job security, career impact, stress

**Pain Amplification**:
- Quantify the impact (dollars, time, resources)
- Connect to broader business goals
- Make it personal for key stakeholders
- Create urgency (why now, cost of delay)

**Example**:
Instead of: "You have a manual process"
Better: "Your team spends 15 hours per week on manual data entry, costing $180K annually in labor. This prevents them from strategic work, which is causing you to miss your growth targets. If this continues for another quarter, you'll fall 12% behind plan."

**Sales enablement support needed**:
- Discovery question frameworks
- Pain amplification techniques
- Industry pain point research
- Impact calculators

---

**C - Champion**
*Find your internal advocate*

**What it is**: An influential person inside the prospect organization who actively sells on your behalf and wants you to win.

**Characteristics of a Strong Champion**:
- Has influence and credibility
- Benefits personally from your solution
- Believes in your solution
- Actively sells for you in meetings you're not in
- Provides insider information and coaching
- Introduces you to key stakeholders
- Helps navigate internal politics

**Champion vs Coach**:
- **Champion**: Wants you to win, sells for you
- **Coach**: Provides information but neutral on outcome

**Red Flags** (Weak Champion):
- Won't introduce you to economic buyer
- Doesn't provide competitive intelligence
- Not attending key meetings
- Doesn't return calls/emails promptly
- Can't or won't articulate value to others

**Champion Development**:
- Identify what they care about (personally and professionally)
- Equip them with materials to sell internally
- Prove you'll make them look good
- Build trust and relationship
- Create mutual wins

**Sales enablement support needed**:
- Champion identification frameworks
- Champion enablement toolkits (executive summaries, comparison matrices)
- Internal selling guides
- Relationship building playbooks

---

**C - Competition (MEDDICC)**
*Know who you're fighting and how to win*

**What it is**: Understanding all competitive alternatives including direct competitors, indirect solutions, status quo, and internal build options.

**Three Types of Competitors** (April Dunford framework):
1. **Direct competitors**: Other vendors selling similar solutions
2. **Indirect competitors**: Different approach to same problem (e.g., consulting, different technology)
3. **Status quo**: Doing nothing, sticking with current process/system

**Key Questions**:
- Who else are you evaluating?
- What are you doing today? (status quo)
- Have you considered building this internally?
- What do you like about [competitor]?
- What concerns do you have about [competitor]?
- How are you leaning right now?

**Competitive Strategy**:
- **Frame decision criteria** around your strengths
- **Set traps** that expose competitor weaknesses
- **Preempt** their expected attacks on you
- **Differentiate** clearly on what matters most

**Sales enablement support needed**:
- Battle cards (see `07-battle-cards-competitive-intelligence.md`)
- Competitive intelligence gathering
- Trap-setting tactics
- Defensive positioning for when competitors attack

---

**P - Paper Process (MEDDPICC)**
*Navigate procurement and legal*

**What it is**: Understanding the contracting, legal review, and procurement process required to get from verbal yes to signed contract.

**Key Questions**:
- What does your contracting process look like?
- Who's involved in legal and procurement?
- What's your standard timeline for contract reviews?
- Are there any special requirements? (e.g., insurance, data processing agreements)
- What typically causes delays?
- Can we get our legal teams connected early?

**Common Delays**:
- Redlines and back-and-forth on terms (1-4 weeks)
- Security questionnaires and reviews (1-3 weeks)
- Procurement paperwork (1-2 weeks)
- Signature authority escalations
- End of quarter/year timing

**Acceleration Tactics**:
- Start legal review early (don't wait for verbal yes)
- Provide standard documents proactively
- Connect legal teams directly
- Understand and accommodate their must-haves
- Have executive escalation paths ready

**Sales enablement support needed**:
- Procurement playbooks
- Legal negotiation guides
- Standard contract templates
- Security review accelerators

---

### SPICED

**Best For**: Disruptive technology, competitive markets, mid-market B2B, 3-6 month cycles

**Origin**: Developed by Winning by Design, specifically for recurring revenue (SaaS) models

**Adoption**: Growing rapidly, especially in competitive, fast-moving markets

**Win Rate Impact**: 37% increase when properly implemented

#### The Framework

**SPICED**:
- **S**ituation
- **P**ain
- **I**mpact
- **C**ritical Event
- **D**ecision

#### Detailed Breakdown

**S - Situation**
*Understand the context*

**What it is**: The prospect's current state, environment, goals, and challenges.

**Key Questions**:
- What are your current goals for this quarter/year?
- What's your current process for [relevant area]?
- What tools are you using today?
- What's working well? What's not?
- What changes are happening in your business?

**Purpose**:
- Build context and rapport
- Understand where they're starting from
- Identify opportunities for impact
- Set up pain discussion

---

**P - Pain**
*Identify the problem*

**What it is**: The specific problem, challenge, or gap the prospect is experiencing.

**Key Questions**:
- What's the biggest challenge with your current approach?
- Where are things breaking down?
- What's frustrating about this?
- What keeps you up at night related to this?

**Difference from MEDDIC "Identify Pain"**: SPICED pain is second step, after understanding situation. More conversational and contextual.

---

**I - Impact**
*Quantify the consequences*

**What it is**: The business and personal impact of the pain, both the cost of the problem and the value of solving it.

**Key Questions**:
- What's the business impact of this pain? (revenue, cost, efficiency)
- How does this affect you personally?
- What could you accomplish if this were solved?
- What's at stake if you don't fix this?

**Quantify**:
- Revenue lost or at risk
- Costs incurred
- Time wasted
- Strategic opportunities missed
- Personal/career impact

**Example**:
"This manual process costs $200K annually in labor, delays product launches by 4-6 weeks (costing $500K in lost revenue per delay), and prevents your team from strategic work. If this continues, you'll miss your annual growth target of 25%, which puts the team's bonuses and your promotion at risk."

---

**C - Critical Event**
*Create urgency*

**What it is**: The event or deadline that makes solving this problem urgent right now.

**Key Questions**:
- Why is this a priority now?
- What's changed that makes this urgent?
- Is there a deadline or event driving this?
- What happens if you don't solve this by [date]?

**Types of Critical Events**:
- **External**: Regulatory change, market shift, competitive threat
- **Internal**: Board deadline, budget cycle, product launch, merger/acquisition
- **Performance**: Missing targets, customer churn, quality issues
- **Personal**: Performance review, new role, career goal

**Without Critical Event**: Deal will slip, stall, or die. Creating urgency is essential for momentum.

**Example**:
"Our biggest customer is up for renewal in Q3 and has indicated concerns about [problem]. If we don't solve this by then, we risk losing a $2M account."

---

**D - Decision**
*Map the path to yes*

**What it is**: Understanding the decision-making process, stakeholders, criteria, and timeline.

**Key Questions**:
- How do decisions like this typically get made here?
- Who else needs to be involved?
- What's your timeline?
- What criteria will you use to evaluate solutions?
- What could prevent or delay this?

**Similar to MEDDIC "Decision Process" but less formal/detailed** - appropriate for shorter, less complex sales.

---

#### Why SPICED Over MEDDIC?

**SPICED advantages**:
- **More conversational**: Flows naturally in discovery calls
- **Customer-centric**: Focuses on their story and context first
- **Modern approach**: Designed for SaaS/recurring revenue
- **Shorter cycles**: Less heavyweight than MEDDIC
- **Impact-focused**: Emphasizes business outcomes early

**When to choose SPICED**:
- Mid-market deals (3-6 month cycles)
- Competitive, fast-moving markets
- Disruptive or new category products
- Buyer-led evaluation processes
- Need for speed and agility

**When to choose MEDDIC instead**:
- Enterprise, highly complex deals
- Multiple stakeholders and approval layers
- Long cycles (12-18+ months)
- Formal procurement processes
- Risk-averse industries (finance, healthcare, government)

#### Implementation Timeline

Similar to MEDDIC: 8-12 weeks for full adoption, with training, CRM integration, and manager reinforcement.

---

### BANT

**Best For**: Transactional sales, SMB, short cycles (<60 days), simple buying (1-3 stakeholders)

**Origin**: Developed by IBM in the 1950s, still widely used for qualifying leads

**Why Still Relevant**: Simple, fast, effective for transactional sales

#### The Framework

**BANT**:
- **B**udget
- **A**uthority
- **N**eed
- **T**imeline (also called "Timeframe" or "Timing")

#### Detailed Breakdown

**B - Budget**
*Can they afford it?*

**Key Questions**:
- Do you have budget allocated for this?
- What's your budget range?
- If not budgeted, could you secure budget?
- What other priorities is this competing with?

**Modern Approach**: Don't lead with budget. Ask later after establishing value. If no budget, help create it by demonstrating ROI.

---

**A - Authority**
*Can they buy?*

**Key Questions**:
- Who makes the final decision on this?
- What's your role in the decision?
- Who else needs to sign off?

**Authority Levels**:
- Decision maker: Can say yes alone
- Influencer: Input but not final say
- Blocker: Can say no but not yes
- User: Will use but doesn't decide

---

**N - Need**
*Do they have a problem we solve?*

**Key Questions**:
- What problem are you trying to solve?
- Why is this important?
- What happens if you don't solve it?

**Qualification**: If there's no clear need, don't waste time.

---

**T - Timeline**
*When will they buy?*

**Key Questions**:
- When do you need this in place?
- What's driving the timeline?
- Is this a priority for this quarter/year?

**Timeline Reality Check**:
- "Someday" or "exploring" = Low priority, nurture
- "This quarter" with critical event = High priority, engage
- "Urgent, ASAP" = Verify why (could be tire-kicking)

---

#### When to Use BANT

**Best Fit**:
- SMB sales (1-3 decision makers)
- Transactional, short cycle (<60 days)
- High-volume, lower deal value (<$25K)
- Simple products/services
- Inside sales/SDR lead qualification

**Not Ideal For**:
- Complex enterprise sales
- Long sales cycles
- Multiple stakeholders
- Strategic, transformational purchases

**Modern BANT**: Many companies use BANT for **lead qualification** (SDRs) then shift to MEDDIC or SPICED for **opportunity management** (AEs).

---

### Challenger Sale

**Best For**: Complex B2B, consultative selling, need to educate and differentiate

**Origin**: Book "The Challenger Sale" by Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson (2011), based on research of 6,000 sales reps

**Core Insight**: Top performers don't just build relationships - they **teach, tailor, and take control**.

#### The Framework

**Three Core Behaviors**:
1. **Teach**: Provide insights that reframe thinking
2. **Tailor**: Customize message for different stakeholders
3. **Take Control**: Push back constructively, drive the process

**Five Seller Profiles** (from research):
- **Challenger** (40% of high performers): Teaches, tailors, takes control
- Relationship Builder: Builds strong customer advocates
- Hard Worker: High activity, persistent
- Lone Wolf: Self-confident, follows own instincts
- Problem Solver: Reliably solves problems

**Key Finding**: Challengers are **disproportionately high performers**, especially in complex B2B sales.

#### Teach for Differentiation

**Teaching vs Pitching**:
- **Pitching**: "Here's what we do, here's why we're great"
- **Teaching**: "Here's something you don't know about your business that you should"

**Commercial Teaching**:
- Offer unique perspective or insight
- Challenge customer's thinking
- Connect insight to your solution
- Make customer think: "I never thought of it that way"

**Example**:
Instead of: "Our platform helps you manage customer data"
Challenger approach: "Most companies think they have a data problem, but our research shows it's actually a decision-making problem. Your teams have data, they just can't act on it fast enough. Let me show you why..."

#### Tailor for Resonance

**Tailoring**:
- Customize message for economic buyer vs technical buyer vs user
- Speak to their specific goals and challenges
- Connect solution to their priorities
- Adjust approach based on their communication style

**Requires**:
- Deep industry and customer research
- Persona-based messaging (see `08-value-proposition-messaging.md`)
- Flexibility and adaptability

#### Take Control

**Constructive Tension**:
- Push back on unrealistic expectations
- Challenge customer's assumptions
- Drive the process forward
- Create urgency
- Be willing to walk away if not a fit

**Example**:
"Based on what you've shared, I don't think our solution is the right fit right now. Here's why... If you were to solve X and Y first, then we could add significant value. Would you like me to introduce you to partners who could help with X and Y?"

**Taking Control ≠ Pushy**: It's about being consultative, honest, and driving toward the right outcome (which might be no deal).

#### When to Use Challenger

**Best Fit**:
- Complex, consultative B2B sales
- Need to differentiate in competitive markets
- Selling transformation vs features
- Educated buyers who've done research
- Longer sales cycles where teaching builds credibility

**Not Ideal For**:
- Transactional, product-led sales
- SMB with simple buying
- Commodity products (little to teach)
- Buyers who just want pricing, not education

---

### Solution Selling

**Best For**: Complex B2B, consultative approach, focus on solving business problems vs selling products

**Origin**: Developed by Mike Bosworth in the 1980s

**Core Principle**: Sell solutions to business problems, not products with features.

#### The Framework

**Pain → Vision → Value → Control**

1. **Diagnose Pain**: Understand the business problem deeply
2. **Create Vision**: Help buyer envision the solution and better future state
3. **Quantify Value**: Calculate the ROI and business impact
4. **Maintain Control**: Manage the evaluation and decision process

**Solution vs Product Mindset**:
- **Product Mindset**: "We have these features, would you like to buy?"
- **Solution Mindset**: "You have this business problem. Let's explore if and how we can solve it."

#### When to Use Solution Selling

**Best Fit**:
- Complex business problems
- Custom or configurable solutions
- Consultative sales approach
- B2B professional services or complex technology

**Modern Evolution**: Many principles of solution selling are embedded in MEDDIC, SPICED, and other modern methodologies.

---

### SPIN Selling

**Best For**: Discovery and questioning framework, works across methodologies

**Origin**: Neil Rackham's research in the 1980s analyzing 35,000 sales calls

**Core Insight**: Top performers ask better questions in a specific sequence.

#### The Framework

**SPIN Question Sequence**:

1. **Situation**: Understand current state
   - "What tools do you use today?"
   - "How is your process currently structured?"

2. **Problem**: Identify difficulties
   - "What challenges do you face with that approach?"
   - "Where does the process break down?"

3. **Implication**: Amplify consequences
   - "What's the impact of that delay on your revenue?"
   - "If this continues, how will it affect your goals?"

4. **Need-Payoff**: Connect to value
   - "If you could solve this, what would that enable?"
   - "How would reducing that time by 50% impact your team?"

**Why It Works**: Moves from facts → pain → consequences → value in a natural conversational flow.

**Use Case**: SPIN is often combined with other methodologies. Use SPIN questions during MEDDIC discovery or SPICED "Situation" and "Pain" phases.

## Methodology Selection Guide

### Decision Matrix

| Your Sales Motion | Recommended Methodology | Why |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----|
| **Enterprise, complex (6-18 mo, $100K+)** | MEDDIC/MEDDICC | Handles complexity, multiple stakeholders, formal processes |
| **Mid-market, competitive (3-6 mo)** | SPICED | Faster, more conversational, impact-focused |
| **SMB, transactional (<60 days)** | BANT | Simple, fast qualification |
| **Consultative, educational** | Challenger | Differentiate through teaching and insight |
| **Problem-solving, solution-focused** | Solution Selling | Focuses on business outcomes vs features |
| **Discovery-focused** | SPIN | Can combine with any methodology |

### Selection Criteria

**Consider**:
1. **Sales cycle length**: Longer cycles need more rigorous frameworks (MEDDIC)
2. **Deal complexity**: More stakeholders = need for structured approach
3. **Deal value**: Higher value = justify time investment in detailed qualification
4. **Buyer sophistication**: Educated buyers may need Challenger approach
5. **Product/market fit**: New categories may benefit from teaching (Challenger)
6. **Sales team experience**: Complex methodologies require training investment
7. **Current approach**: What's already working that you can build on?

**Common Combinations**:
- **BANT for SDRs** (lead qualification) → **MEDDIC for AEs** (opportunity management)
- **SPICED framework** + **SPIN questions** (discovery technique)
- **MEDDIC structure** + **Challenger approach** (consultative + rigorous)

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Get Executive Buy-In

**Why Critical**:
- Methodology changes behavior and process
- Requires consistent reinforcement
- Needs manager buy-in and coaching
- May require CRM changes and investments

**How**:

---

### 3. Integrate with CRM

**Salesforce/HubSpot Integration**:

**For MEDDIC**, add fields:
- Metrics (text/currency)
- Economic Buyer Identified (checkbox, lookup)
- Decision Criteria Documented (checkbox, long text)
- Decision Process Mapped (checkbox, long text)
- Pain Identified and Quantified (checkbox, text)
- Champion Confirmed (checkbox, lookup)
- Competition Identified (picklist, text)
- MEDDIC Score (0-7 or 0-8 depending on variant)

**Create Views/Reports**:
- MEDDIC Qualification Dashboard
- Opportunities by MEDDIC Score
- Missing Information Report (which components are blank)
- Win Rate by MEDDIC Score

**Validation Rules**:
- Can't move to certain stages without MEDDIC fields completed
- Economic Buyer required to close
- Metrics required for forecast

---

### 4. Manager Reinforcement

**Weekly/Bi-Weekly Deal Reviews**:
- Use methodology as review framework
- "Walk me through the MEDDIC" for each key opportunity
- Coach on gaps and risks
- Model questioning and qualification

**1:1 Coaching**:
- Review call recordings through methodology lens
- Practice role-plays
- Celebrate good application
- Remediate gaps

**Inspect What You Expect**:
- Managers review CRM data for methodology completeness
- Tie completion to compensation or performance reviews (if appropriate)
- Recognize and reward strong adopters

---

### 5. Measure and Optimize

**Adoption Metrics**:
- % of opportunities with methodology fields completed
- % of forecast opportunities fully qualified
- Manager coaching session completion
- Rep self-reported confidence

**Target**: 85-90% adoption within 12 weeks

**Performance Metrics**:
- Win rate by methodology score (do higher scores win more?)
- Sales cycle length (does methodology reduce it?)
- Forecast accuracy (better qualification = better forecasting)
- Ramp time (do new reps ramp faster with methodology?)

**Continuous Improvement**:
- Which components correlate most with wins? Emphasize those.
- Where do reps struggle? Add training/enablement.
- How do top performers use it differently? Share best practices.
- Quarterly refresher training and recertification

---

### 6. Drive Adoption Through Change Management

**See `25-change-management.md` and `26-driving-adoption.md` for full guides**

**Key Tactics**:
- **Communication**: Why we're doing this, what's in it for reps, how it helps them
- **Champions**: Identify early adopters and success stories
- **Reinforcement**: Consistent messaging from leadership and managers
- **Incentives**: Recognition, leaderboards, celebrations
- **Support**: Office hours, Slack channels, ongoing help

**90%+ Adoption = 2.5x Impact**:
- 9.8% revenue improvement (vs 4.1% at 80-90%)
- 20.7% quota attainment increase (vs 6.7%)
- 24.6% win rate increase (vs 16.6%)

Adoption is everything. Great methodology poorly adopted < Good methodology with 90%+ adoption.

---

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Implementing Methodology Without Training

**Problem**: Rolling out CRM fields and expecting adoption without teaching why or how.

**Impact**: Low adoption, checkbox compliance without understanding, no behavior change.

**Solution**: Comprehensive training program (2-3 weeks), certification, ongoing coaching.

---

### 2. No Manager Reinforcement

**Problem**: Methodology taught once, then never mentioned again in deal reviews or coaching.

**Impact**: Reps revert to old habits, methodology seen as "flavor of the month."

**Solution**: Managers must use methodology in every deal review, 1:1, and coaching session. It's not optional.

---

### 3. CRM Overload

**Problem**: Adding 20+ new required fields that feel like busywork.

**Impact**: Rep frustration, "CRM is a pain," low adoption.

**Solution**: Start with core components (MEDDIC = 6-8 fields), keep it simple, show value before adding complexity.

---

### 4. Wrong Methodology for Sales Motion

**Problem**: Implementing MEDDIC for transactional SMB sales (overkill) or BANT for enterprise (insufficient).

**Impact**: Poor fit, low adoption, methodology doesn't improve results.

**Solution**: Use selection matrix above, match methodology to your actual sales complexity.

---

### 5. Rigid Application

**Problem**: "You must fill out every field perfectly or we can't close the deal."

**Impact**: Compliance focus vs critical thinking, reps gaming the system, methodology becomes checkbox exercise.

**Solution**: Teach principles and judgment. Some deals may not have all components. Use methodology as framework, not rigid checklist.

---

### 6. No Measurement

**Problem**: Implementing methodology but never checking if it improves results.

**Impact**: Can't prove ROI, don't know if it's working, can't optimize.

**Solution**: Baseline metrics before implementation, track adoption and performance metrics, correlate methodology rigor with win rates.
