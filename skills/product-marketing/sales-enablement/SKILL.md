## Key Principles

### Start with Strategy, Not Tactics
Don't buy platforms or create content without a clear charter and strategy. Foundation first.

### Measure What Matters
Track metrics that connect to business outcomes, not activity metrics. ROI must be provable.

### Adoption > Creation
A mediocre program with 90%+ adoption beats a perfect program with 50% adoption.

### Continuous, Not Episodic
80-90% of training is lost after one month. Enablement must be ongoing and reinforced.

### Collaborate Cross-Functionally
Enablement can't succeed in a silo. Partner with marketing, product, CS, and RevOps.

### Adapt by Segment
SMB, mid-market, and enterprise require fundamentally different enablement approaches.

### Leverage Technology
42% productivity boost with well-integrated tech stack. Choose tools that drive outcomes.

### Enable the Enablers
Managers must reinforce and coach. Enable them to enable their teams.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **No charter or clear mission** → Becomes order-taking instead of strategic
2. **Skipping business case** → No executive buy-in or adequate resources
3. **Content dumping** → Overwhelming reps instead of curating essentials
4. **One-size-fits-all training** → Not adapting to roles, segments, or experience
5. **Poor change management** → New initiatives die without adoption strategy
6. **No measurement** → Can't prove ROI or optimize programs
7. **Tool-first approach** → Buying platforms before defining strategy
8. **Ignoring sales managers** → Managers must reinforce and coach
9. **Weak onboarding** → Missing 54% productivity gain opportunity
10. **Silo operation** → Not collaborating with marketing, product, CS, RevOps

## Getting Started: Your Path

### If you're a solo enabler
Start with: 01-foundations → 02-business-case → 11-onboarding → 06-playbooks
Focus on: High-leverage activities, templates, quick wins, executive buy-in for resources

### If you're building a team
Start with: 03-charter → 04-team-structure → 05-content-lifecycle → 09-methodologies
Focus on: Clear roles, scalable systems, cross-functional alignment

### If you're transforming existing enablement
Start with: 01-foundations (maturity assessment) → identify biggest gaps → prioritize
Focus on: Data-driven optimization, adoption improvement, technology leverage
