## Quick Decision Trees

### "What tier is my launch?"

**Ask:**
1. Does this acquire NEW customers or open NEW markets? → YES = Tier 1 candidate
2. Does this impact REVENUE or significantly improve RETENTION? → YES = Tier 2 candidate
3. Is this maintenance, bug fixes, or minor improvements? → YES = Tier 3

## Key Principles (The Foundation of 1% Launches)

### 1. Customer Discovery Before Building
**Principle:** Validate problem and solution before investing in product.
**Why it matters:** 95% of products fail due to lack of market understanding.
**How to apply:** 8-10 customer interviews, jobs-to-be-done research, landing page validation.

### 2. Positioning Precedes Messaging
**Principle:** You must know WHO you serve, WHAT makes you different, and WHY it matters before writing a single word of copy.
**Framework:** April Dunford's 5 components (best-fit customers, alternatives, differentiation, value, market category).
**Application:** Complete positioning workshop before any launch materials.

### 3. Launch Tiers Drive Resource Allocation
**Principle:** Not all launches deserve equal investment. Tier 1 launches are rare but critical.
**Reality check:** Marketing teams can only handle 2 Tier 1 launches per quarter maximum.
**Decision criteria:** Market/business impact, NOT development effort.

### 4. Test Everything Before Launch Day
**Principle:** Assumptions are dangerous. Validate with real users.
**What to test:** Value proposition clarity, messaging resonance, pricing psychology, onboarding friction.
**Methods:** Wynter message testing, UserTesting, sales pitch tests, beta programs.

### 5. Cross-Functional Alignment is Non-Negotiable
**Principle:** A launch is only as good as its weakest functional handoff.
**RACI application:** Define who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed for every launch activity.
**Communication:** Weekly all-hands during pre-launch, daily standups final 2 weeks.

### 6. The First 48 Hours Make or Break Momentum
**Principle:** Launch day execution requires war room intensity and real-time response.
**Preparation:** Hour-by-hour playbook, designated responders, monitoring dashboards, crisis protocols.
**2024 reality:** News travels 6x faster online - be ready for rapid response.

### 7. Product-Led Growth Wins in 2024
**Principle:** Let the product sell itself. PLG companies grow 2.4x faster than sales-led.
**Core elements:** Fast time-to-value (<15 min), clear Aha! moment, viral loops, self-serve model.
**Trend:** 75% of B2B buyers prefer rep-free experiences.

### 8. Metrics Drive Decisions, Not Opinions
**Principle:** AARRR framework (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, Revenue) guides optimization.
**Key metrics:** CAC, LTV, activation rate, retention curves, NPS, MRR/ARR.
**Discipline:** A/B test relentlessly. Statistical significance > gut feel.

### 9. Post-Launch is Where Real Work Begins
**Principle:** Launch is a starting line, not a finish line.
**Reality:** Week 1 feedback reveals what months of planning missed.
**Iteration:** 2-week sprint cycles, continuous deployment, feedback loops.

### 10. Community Beats Advertising
**Principle:** Authentic engagement on Product Hunt, Reddit, IndieHackers generates better ROI than paid ads for early-stage launches.
**Authenticity requirement:** 2024 communities punish promotional content. Provide value first.
**Long game:** Start building community 3-6 months before launch.

### 11. Video Content Dominates (2024 Trend)
**Principle:** Short-form video views on LinkedIn increased 6x in 2024.
**Application:** Product demos, founder stories, customer testimonials, feature highlights.
**Platforms:** LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok (B2C), Instagram Reels.

### 12. Pricing Anchors Perception Forever
**Principle:** Your launch price creates permanent perception. Raising later is hard.
**Psychology:** If you anchor too low, you may never escape that gravity.
**Strategy:** Value-based pricing, Good-Better-Best tiers, test before public launch.

### 13. AI Levels the Playing Field for Solopreneurs
**Principle:** 2024 GenAI enables one-person launches that rival small teams.
**Applications:** Content creation, image generation, customer support, analytics.
**Reality:** 42% of solopreneurs prioritize revenue over new launches - AI helps do more with less.

### 14. Crisis Preparedness Prevents Disasters
**Principle:** 51% of companies lack crisis communication plans, yet crises are inevitable.
**Preparation:** Pre-written response templates, designated spokesperson, escalation paths.
**Speed matters:** First response should be within 1 hour of issue identification.

### 15. Learn from Failure (Most Products Fail)
**Principle:** 95% failure rate means learning from mistakes is competitive advantage.
**Common failures:** Poor pricing, weak differentiation, insufficient market research, bad timing, feature bloat.
**Response:** Fast pivots, customer feedback integration, willingness to kill bad ideas.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid (Lessons from 2024 Failures)

### Strategic Mistakes

1. **Insufficient Market Research**
   - **Impact:** #1 reason for 95% failure rate
   - **Solution:** 8-10 customer discovery interviews, JTBD research, competitive analysis

2. **Weak Value Proposition**
   - **Impact:** Prospects don't understand why they should care
   - **Solution:** Test messaging on Wynter, 30-second pitch test, mom test

3. **Wrong Pricing**
   - **Impact:** Can kill an otherwise great product
   - **Solution:** Value-based pricing research, A/B testing, Good-Better-Best tiers

4. **Launching with Missing Features**
   - **Example:** Threads failed despite Meta's resources due to incomplete MVP
   - **Solution:** Core value must work perfectly, nice-to-haves can wait

5. **Poor Differentiation**
   - **Impact:** Lost in sea of competitors
   - **Solution:** Category creation vs competition, positioning workshops, unique capabilities

### Execution Mistakes

6. **No Launch Tier Framework**
   - **Impact:** Every launch gets maximum resources, team burnout
   - **Solution:** Implement Tier 1/2/3 framework, match resources to impact

7. **Skipping Beta Testing**
   - **Impact:** Major bugs and usability issues on launch day
   - **Solution:** 3-4 week closed beta minimum, feedback loops

8. **Inadequate Sales Enablement**
   - **Impact:** Sales team can't articulate value, deals stall
   - **Solution:** Battlecards, training sessions, discovery questions, demo environments

9. **No Post-Launch Plan**
   - **Impact:** Momentum dies after launch day
   - **Solution:** 90-day growth plan, iteration cycles, continuous optimization

10. **Missing Cross-Functional Alignment**
    - **Impact:** Product/Marketing/Sales/CS have different stories
    - **Solution:** RACI matrix, weekly syncs, single source of truth

### Marketing Mistakes

11. **One-Size-Fits-All Messaging**
    - **Impact:** Doesn't resonate with any audience
    - **Solution:** Persona-specific messaging (technical buyers, economic buyers, users)

12. **Weak Pre-Launch Audience Building**
    - **Impact:** No one shows up on launch day
    - **Solution:** 4-8 week pre-launch, waitlist building, community engagement

13. **Ignoring SEO Before Launch**
    - **Impact:** Organic traffic takes months to build
    - **Solution:** Publish content 4-6 weeks before launch for indexing

14. **Over-Reliance on Paid Advertising**
    - **Impact:** Expensive, not sustainable for early-stage
    - **Solution:** Community-first (Product Hunt, Reddit), organic content

15. **No Crisis Communication Plan**
    - **Impact:** Scrambling during launch day issues
    - **Solution:** Pre-written templates, war room protocols, designated responders

### Measurement Mistakes

16. **Vanity Metrics Over Real Metrics**
    - **Impact:** Chasing social media followers instead of revenue
    - **Solution:** AARRR framework, focus on activation and retention

17. **No Statistical Rigor**
    - **Impact:** Acting on noise rather than signal
    - **Solution:** Proper sample sizes, confidence intervals, A/B testing discipline

18. **Set and Forget**
    - **Impact:** Market changes, messaging becomes stale
    - **Solution:** Quarterly message testing, continuous iteration

### Step 1: Assess Your Starting Point

**Answer these questions:**
- [ ] What are you launching? (New product / Major feature / Market expansion / Repositioning)
- [ ] What tier is this launch? (Use `launch-tier-assessment.md`)
- [ ] Are you a solopreneur or part of a team?
- [ ] What's your timeline constraint? (Ideal vs real)
- [ ] What's your budget? (<$10K / $10-50K / $50-100K / $100K+)
- [ ] Do you have clear positioning? (If no, start with 04-positioning-strategy)
- [ ] Have you validated customer need? (If no, start with customer discovery)

### Step 2: Choose Your Playbook

**Solopreneurs:**
1. Read `01-solopreneur-launch-playbook.md`
2. Select compressed timeline from `05-90-day-roadmap.md` (can condense to 6-8 weeks)
3. Focus on community tactics: `12-community-launch-tactics.md`
4. Use lean beta testing: `07-lean-beta-testing.md`
5. Track PLG metrics: `15-post-launch-plg.md` + `16-metrics-kpis.md`

**Enterprise Teams (Tier 1):**
1. Read `02-enterprise-launch-coordination.md` + `03-launch-tier-framework.md`
2. Follow full `05-90-day-roadmap.md` (16-24 weeks)
3. Establish RACI: `09-cross-functional-raci.md`
4. Enable sales: `10-sales-enablement.md`
5. Execute multi-channel: `11-multi-channel-marketing.md`
6. Prepare for launch day: `13-launch-day-playbook.md` + `14-crisis-management.md`

**Enterprise Teams (Tier 2-3):**
1. Determine tier: `03-launch-tier-framework.md`
2. Compressed roadmap: `05-90-day-roadmap.md` (8-12 weeks)
3. Targeted enablement: `10-sales-enablement.md` (focus on battlecards)
4. Community + content: `12-community-launch-tactics.md` + content from `11-multi-channel-marketing.md`
5. Core metrics: `16-metrics-kpis.md`

### Step 3: Load Relevant References

Based on your gaps and needs, progressively load:
- **Missing positioning?** → `04-positioning-strategy.md`
- **Need pricing help?** → `08-pricing-packaging.md`
- **Confused about GTM motion?** → `06-gtm-strategy.md`
- **Platform-specific launch?** → `advanced/product-hunt-mastery.md`, `advanced/linkedin-launch-strategy.md`, etc.

### Step 4: Use Templates to Organize Work

Start with:
1. `launch-tier-assessment.md` - Confirm your tier
2. `90-day-roadmap-template.xlsx` - Build your timeline
3. `launch-checklist.md` - Track all 87 action items
4. Tier-specific templates based on your needs

### Step 5: Execute with Discipline

**Don't skip:**
- Customer discovery and validation
- Positioning before messaging
- Beta testing with real users
- Sales enablement and training
- Launch day war room
- Post-launch iteration cycles

**Can compress:**
- GTM strategy (if positioning is clear)
- Content creation (with team/AI)
- Pre-launch audience building (if existing community)

**Never compress:**
- Launch day execution (must be perfect)
- Crisis preparation (Murphy's Law applies)
- Post-launch monitoring (catch issues fast)

### Step 6: Measure and Iterate

**Week 1 post-launch:**
- Monitor AARRR metrics hourly
- Gather qualitative feedback from first users
- Fix critical bugs and friction points
- Celebrate wins, diagnose failures

**Weeks 2-4:**
- Analyze cohort data (retention curves)
- Run messaging A/B tests
- Iterate on onboarding flow
- Refine pricing if needed

**Weeks 5-8:**
- Full launch retrospective
- Update messaging based on learnings
- Scale what works, kill what doesn't
- Plan next iteration or feature launch

### Step 7: Build Your Launch Muscle

**After your launch:**
- Document your retrospective
- Update templates with learnings
- Build repeatable playbooks
- Train team members
- Prepare for next launch

**Continuous improvement:**
- Study competitor launches
- Follow Product Marketing Alliance
- Join communities (PMA, PMM Camp, IndieHackers)
- Read case studies and post-mortems
- Share your own learnings
