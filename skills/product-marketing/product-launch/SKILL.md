# Product Launch

Execute product launches from planning through post-launch optimization.

**📊 RESEARCH-BACKED**: Built from 2024-2025 research across Product Marketing Alliance and launch frameworks.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Plan product launches** - 90-day roadmaps, launch tiers, resource allocation
- **Execute launches** - Day-of coordination, multi-channel tactics
- **Coordinate teams** - Cross-functional RACI, stakeholder management
- **Optimize post-launch** - Metrics, iteration, growth tactics

**NOT for:**
- Positioning (use `positioning` skill - PREREQUISITE)
- Messaging (use `messaging` skill - PREREQUISITE)
- Message testing (use `rollout-and-launch` skill)
- Deep sales enablement (use `sales-enablement` skill)

**Prerequisites:** Clear positioning and validated messaging required before launching.

## The Launch Process

**Timeline:** 16-24 weeks (Tier 1), 8-12 weeks (Tier 2), 1-4 weeks (Tier 3)

```
PLAN → BUILD → PREPARE → LAUNCH → OPTIMIZE
(4-6w)  (4-8w)  (2-4w)    (1 day)  (4-8w continuous)
```

## Quick Decision Trees

**What tier is my launch?**
→ New product or market = Tier 1
→ Major feature, revenue impact = Tier 2
→ Minor update = Tier 3
→ Read: core/01-launch-tier-framework.md

**I'm a solopreneur:**
→ Read: core/01-launch-tier-framework.md (solopreneur section)
→ Then: core/04-cross-functional-coordination.md (solo playbook)
→ Focus on: core/05-multi-channel-tactics.md (community tactics)

**I'm in an enterprise:**
→ Read: core/01-launch-tier-framework.md
→ Then: core/04-cross-functional-coordination.md (enterprise section)
→ Focus on: RACI, stakeholder management

**I don't have positioning/messaging:**
→ **STOP** - Use `positioning` skill first (1-2 weeks)
→ Then use `messaging` skill (2-3 weeks)
→ Return here when complete

## Key Principles

### 1. Positioning and Messaging Are Prerequisites

Cannot launch without:
- Clear positioning (who you're for, why different)
- Validated messaging (value props that resonate)

**95% of products fail due to insufficient market understanding.**

### 2. Launch Tiers Prevent Burnout

Not all launches deserve equal resources:
- **Tier 1:** Max 2 per quarter, full resources
- **Tier 2:** 4-8 per quarter, selective resources
- **Tier 3:** Ongoing, minimal resources

### 3. First 48 Hours Matter Most

Launch day requires:
- War room intensity
- Hour-by-hour playbook
- Real-time monitoring
- Crisis protocols

### 4. Post-Launch is Where Work Begins

Week 1 feedback reveals what planning missed:
- 2-week sprint cycles
- Tight feedback loops
- AARRR metrics

## Related Skills

**Prerequisites (complete FIRST):**
1. **`positioning`** - Who you're for, differentiation (1-2 weeks)
2. **`messaging`** - Value propositions, multi-audience (2-3 weeks)

**Complementary:**
- **`sales-enablement`** - Deep battlecards, training
- **`competitive-intelligence`** - Market analysis
- **`rollout-and-launch`** - Message testing, workshops

**For specific launch types:**
- **`personas`** - Buyer intelligence
- **`pricing-packaging`** - Advanced pricing (if not using core/advanced here)

## Integration Workflow

```
Step 1: POSITIONING (positioning skill) → 1-2 weeks
Step 2: MESSAGING (messaging skill) → 2-3 weeks
Step 3: LAUNCH PLANNING (this skill, core 1-3) → 4-8 weeks
Step 4: LAUNCH EXECUTION (this skill, core 4-6) → 2-4 weeks + 1 day
Step 5: POST-LAUNCH (this skill, core 7-8) → 4-8 weeks
```

## Typical Timelines

| Launch Tier | Timeline | Minimum |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Tier 1 (Major) | 16-24 weeks | 12-16 weeks |
| Tier 2 (Feature) | 8-12 weeks | 6-8 weeks |
| Tier 3 (Update) | 1-4 weeks | N/A |

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Skipping positioning/messaging** → 95% failure rate
2. **No tier framework** → Team burnout
3. **Weak pre-launch testing** → Launch day bugs
4. **No post-launch plan** → Momentum dies
5. **Missing cross-functional alignment** → Conflicting stories

## Getting Started

**New to launches?**
1. Check: Do you have positioning/messaging? (If NO, use those skills first)
2. Read: core/01-launch-tier-framework.md
3. Read: core/02-90-day-roadmap.md
4. Follow your tier's playbook

**Have experience?**
1. Confirm tier: core/01-launch-tier-framework.md
2. Jump to your phase (planning/execution/post-launch)
3. Use checklists to verify nothing missed

**Mid-launch?**
→ Jump to core/06-launch-day-playbook.md
→ Use assets/checklists/launch-day-checklist.md
