# Product Launch

Execute world-class product launches from planning through post-launch optimization.

**📊 RESEARCH-BACKED**: Built from 2024-2025 research across Product Marketing Alliance, launch frameworks, and practitioner insights.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Launch new products** - B2B SaaS, consumer products, mobile apps
- **Release major features** - Significant product updates with market impact
- **Enter new markets** - Geographic or segment expansion
- **Execute launch roadmaps** - 90-day planning and execution
- **Coordinate launches** - Cross-functional team orchestration
- **Optimize post-launch** - Growth, retention, and iteration

**NOT for:**
- Positioning (use `positioning` skill first - PREREQUISITE)
- Messaging (use `messaging` skill first - PREREQUISITE)
- Message testing or workshops (use `rollout-and-launch` skill)

**Next steps after launch:**
→ Use `rollout-and-launch` for messaging rollouts
→ Continue with growth optimization in this skill

## Prerequisites

### Must Have Before Launching

✅ **Clear positioning** - Use `positioning` skill if not complete
✅ **Validated messaging** - Use `messaging` skill if not complete
✅ **Defined personas** - Use `personas` skill for buyer intelligence

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Do not launch without positioning and messaging. 95% of product failures are due to insufficient market understanding.

## The Launch Process

**Timeline:** 16-24 weeks for Tier 1 launch, 8-12 weeks for Tier 2, 1-4 weeks for Tier 3

```
DISCOVER → STRATEGY → BUILD → PREPARE → LAUNCH → GROW → OPTIMIZE
(2-4 wks)  (2-3 wks)   (4-12 wks) (4-6 wks)  (1 day)  (4-8 wks) (continuous)
```

## Quick Decision Trees

**What tier is my launch?**
→ New product, new market = Tier 1
→ Major feature, revenue impact = Tier 2
→ Maintenance, minor update = Tier 3
→ Read: core/03-launch-tier-framework.md

**I'm a solopreneur:**
→ Read: core/01-solopreneur-launch-playbook.md
→ Focus on: Community tactics (core/11), PLG (core/14)
→ Timeline: 8-12 weeks compressed

**I'm in an enterprise:**
→ Read: core/02-enterprise-launch-coordination.md
→ Focus on: RACI (core/08), Sales enablement (core/09)
→ Timeline: 16-24 weeks full process

**I don't have positioning/messaging:**
→ **STOP** - Use `positioning` skill first (1-2 weeks)
→ Then use `messaging` skill (2-3 weeks)
→ Return here with completed positioning/messaging

## Key Principles

### 1. Positioning and Messaging Are Non-Negotiable

You cannot launch successfully without:
- Clear positioning (who you're for, why you're different)
- Validated messaging (value propositions that resonate)

**95% of products fail due to insufficient market understanding.**

### 2. Launch Tiers Drive Resource Allocation

Not all launches deserve equal investment:
- **Tier 1:** Maximum 2 per quarter, full resources
- **Tier 2:** 4-8 per quarter, selective resources
- **Tier 3:** Ongoing, minimal resources

### 3. Test Everything Before Launch Day

Assumptions are dangerous:
- Beta test with real users
- Validate messaging with Wynter/UserTesting (use `rollout-and-launch` skill)
- Test pricing psychology
- Validate onboarding friction

### 4. The First 48 Hours Matter Most

Launch day execution requires:
- War room intensity
- Hour-by-hour playbook
- Real-time monitoring
- Crisis protocols ready

### 5. Post-Launch is Where Real Work Begins

Week 1 feedback reveals what months of planning missed:
- 2-week sprint cycles
- Continuous deployment
- Tight feedback loops
- AARRR metrics tracking

## Related Skills

**Prerequisites (do these FIRST):**
1. **`positioning`** - Who you're for, why you're different (1-2 weeks)
2. **`messaging`** - Value propositions, multi-audience messaging (2-3 weeks)

**Complementary (use during launch):**
- **`personas`** - Buyer intelligence and research
- **`sales-enablement`** - Detailed battlecards, training programs
- **`competitive-intelligence`** - Deep competitive analysis
- **`rollout-and-launch`** - Message testing, internal rollout, workshops

**Next steps after launch:**
- Continue with core/14-17 for post-launch optimization
- Return to `messaging` skill if messaging needs refinement

## Integration Workflow

```
Step 1: POSITIONING (positioning skill) → 1-2 weeks
Step 2: MESSAGING (messaging skill) → 2-3 weeks
Step 3: LAUNCH PLANNING (this skill, core 1-11) → 4-12 weeks
Step 4: LAUNCH EXECUTION (this skill, core 12-13) → 1 day
Step 5: POST-LAUNCH (this skill, core 14-17) → 4-8 weeks
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Skipping positioning/messaging** → 95% failure rate cause
2. **No launch tier framework** → Every launch gets max resources, team burnout
3. **Weak pre-launch testing** → Major bugs on launch day
4. **No post-launch plan** → Momentum dies after day 1
5. **Missing cross-functional alignment** → Teams tell different stories

## Typical Timelines

| Launch Tier | Timeline | Can Compress? |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Tier 1 (Major) | 16-24 weeks | ⚠️ Min 12-16 weeks |
| Tier 2 (Feature) | 8-12 weeks | ✓ Yes, to 6-8 weeks |
| Tier 3 (Update) | 1-4 weeks | ✓ Yes |
