## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**1. Starting Too Big**
- Don't try to cover 20 competitors on day one
- Focus on top 3-5 Tier 1 competitors first
- Build depth before breadth

**2. Creating Shelf-ware**
- Don't create assets that sales won't use
- Involve sales in creation process
- Prioritize actionable intelligence over comprehensive research

**3. Lack of Executive Sponsorship**
- Don't start without leadership buy-in
- Secure budget and organizational support upfront
- Report progress and wins regularly

**4. Ignoring Ethics**
- Never cross ethical or legal boundaries for intelligence
- Follow SCIP Code of Ethics religiously
- When in doubt, consult legal team

**5. One-Time Project Mentality**
- CI is ongoing, not a one-time deliverable
- Plan for continuous updates and maintenance
- Build sustainable workflows and cadence

**6. Working in Isolation**
- Don't hoard intelligence or work in silo
- Engage sales, product, marketing throughout
- Create feedback loops and collaboration

**7. Focusing on Data, Not Insights**
- Don't just collect information without analysis
- Translate data into actionable insights
- Answer "so what?" for every piece of intelligence

**8. No Measurement**
- Don't skip metrics and ROI tracking
- Measure adoption, satisfaction, and business impact
- Use data to justify continued investment and expansion
