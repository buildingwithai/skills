# Competitive Intelligence Foundations & Principles

## What is Competitive Intelligence?

**Competitive Intelligence (CI)** is the ethical and legal collection, analysis, and application of information about competitors, market trends, and the business environment to support strategic decision-making and drive competitive advantage.

### Key Distinctions

**CI vs Market Research**
- **Market Research**: Focuses on customers, markets, and trends
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Focuses on competitors, their strategies, and tactical responses
- **Overlap**: Both inform go-to-market strategy and product decisions

**CI vs Business Intelligence**
- **Business Intelligence**: Internal data analysis (sales, operations, performance)
- **Competitive Intelligence**: External intelligence about competitors and market dynamics
- **Integration**: Best programs combine both for complete market picture

**CI vs Corporate Espionage**
- **CI**: Legal, ethical, open-source intelligence gathering
- **Espionage**: Illegal activities (theft, bribery, deception, hacking)
- **Critical Difference**: CI strictly adheres to SCIP Code of Ethics
