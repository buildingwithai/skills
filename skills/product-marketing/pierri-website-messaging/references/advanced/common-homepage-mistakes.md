## Introduction

After reviewing hundreds of B2B SaaS homepages, Anthony Pierri has identified recurring patterns of mistakes that kill conversion. This guide covers the most common errors and how to fix them.

**Key insight**: Most homepage problems stem from **unclear positioning**, not bad copywriting or design.

---

## MISTAKE #1: Refusing to Choose a Target Audience

### The Problem

**Symptom**: Homepage tries to appeal to everyone.

**Example messaging**:
- "For teams that want to work better"
- "Any company can benefit"
- "Built for modern businesses"

**Why it fails**: When you speak to everyone, you resonate with no one. Generic messaging is invisible messaging.

### The Root Cause

**Fear of excluding potential customers**. Companies think:
- "If we narrow our target, we'll lose opportunities"
- "Our product works for multiple audiences, so our homepage should too"
- "We can't choose just one segment"

**The truth**: Narrowing increases resonance exponentially with your target while only linearly decreasing total addressable market.

### How to Fix It

**Step 1**: Pick 1-2 segments to focus on for next 6-12 months

**Step 2**: Write homepage for THEM specifically

**Step 3**: Create separate landing pages for other segments

**Example fixes**:
- ❌ "For teams that collaborate"
- ✅ "For design teams at tech companies"

- ❌ "For any sales organization"
- ✅ "For mid-market B2B sales teams with 10-50 reps"

**Resource**: Use `10-target-audience-selection.md` to narrow your focus

## MISTAKE #2: Vague or Unclear Value Proposition

### The Problem

**Symptom**: Visitor can't tell what the product actually does in 5 seconds.

**Example messaging**:
- "Transform the future of work"
- "Reimagine collaboration"
- "The all-in-one platform for success"
- "Empower your team"

**Why it fails**: Visitors don't have time to decode your vision. If it's not immediately clear what you do, they bounce.

### Real Example Analysis

**Before** (vague):
"Building the future of teamwork"

**Visitor's reaction**: "Is it a chat app? Project management? Something else?"

**After** (clear):
"Team chat organized in channels, not email threads"

**Visitor's reaction**: "Oh, it's a team chat tool. I get it."

### How to Fix It

**Use the Clarity Test**: Show your hero section to someone unfamiliar with your product for 5 seconds. Ask: "What does this company do?"

**If they can't answer correctly**: Too vague. Rewrite.

**Fix patterns**:

**Pattern 1**: Use clear category
- "The collaborative design tool"
- "CRM for real estate agents"
- "Issue tracking for software teams"

**Pattern 2**: Use clear use case
- "Schedule meetings without email back-and-forth"
- "Send video messages instead of meetings"
- "Design websites without code"

**Pattern 3**: Category + Differentiation
- "The Chrome replacement for power users"
- "Issue tracking you'll actually enjoy using"

**Resource**: Use `01-positioning-foundation.md` to clarify your positioning

## MISTAKE #3: Leading with Generic Benefits

### The Problem

**Symptom**: Homepage leads with vague outcomes instead of specific capabilities.

**Example messaging**:
- "Save time and increase productivity"
- "Drive growth and revenue"
- "Boost efficiency"
- "Achieve your goals"

**Why it fails**:
1. Every product claims these benefits
2. No differentiation
3. Doesn't explain HOW

### The Psychology

**What buyers think**:
- "Everyone says they save time. How do YOU save time?"
- "What can I actually DO with your product?"
- "Why is this different from the 10 other tools that promise the same thing?"

### How to Fix It

**Apply the Features-Capabilities-Benefits framework**:

1. **Lead with capabilities** (what they can DO)
2. **Support with features** (how it works)
3. **End with benefits** (outcomes achieved)

**Examples**:

❌ **Before** (generic benefits):
"Increase your team's productivity"

✅ **After** (capability → benefit):
"Design in the same file simultaneously with unlimited teammates → Ship features 2x faster by eliminating review cycles"

❌ **Before**:
"Save time on scheduling"

✅ **After**:
"Send a link, let people book time directly on your calendar → Save 5 hours per week, no more email ping-pong"

**Resource**: Use `03-features-capabilities-benefits.md` for the full framework

## MISTAKE #4: Category Creation Without Massive Budget

### The Problem

**Symptom**: Inventing new category names instead of using familiar ones.

**Example messaging**:
- "The customer insight orchestration platform"
- "Revenue intelligence operating system"
- "Collaborative visual workspace" (when you mean "whiteboard")

**Why it fails**: Even companies with $100M+ marketing budgets (Slack, Miro, Airtable) couldn't get buyers to adopt their invented categories.

### Real Examples

**Slack** tried: "Where work happens" / "Collaboration hub"
**Buyers still say**: "Chat app" or "like Teams"

**Miro** tried: "Collaborative visual workspace"
**Buyers still say**: "Online whiteboard"

**Airtable** tried: New category (database/spreadsheet hybrid)
**Buyers still say**: "Like a fancy spreadsheet" or "database"

### How to Fix It

**Use established categories** and differentiate within them:

❌ **Category creation**:
"The sales acceleration platform"

✅ **Established category**:
"The CRM built for speed"

❌ **Made-up category**:
"Customer insight orchestration platform"

✅ **Clear category**:
"Survey software with AI-powered analysis"

**When you CAN create a category**:
- You have $50M+ for marketing
- You can educate the market for 3-5 years
- You have no competitors to position against

**For everyone else**: Use known categories.

**Resource**: Use `09-category-creation-adoption.md` for full guidance

## MISTAKE #5: Confusing Features with Capabilities

### The Problem

**Symptom**: Listing technical features without explaining what users can DO.

**Example messaging**:
- "Real-time sync"
- "Cloud-based architecture"
- "API access"
- "Advanced analytics"

**Why it fails**: Buyers don't care about features per se. They care about what they can accomplish with them.

### Example Analysis

❌ **Feature-focused** (unclear value):
"Our platform has real-time sync, cloud storage, and version control"

**Buyer's reaction**: "So what? What can I actually do with those?"

✅ **Capability-focused** (clear value):
"Access your files from anywhere, see changes instantly across your team, and restore any previous version"

**Buyer's reaction**: "Oh, I can work from anywhere, collaborate live, and never lose work. Got it."

### How to Fix It

**Map each feature to a capability**:

| Feature | Capability (what you can DO) |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| Real-time sync | See changes instantly across your team |
| Cloud-based | Access files from anywhere, any device |
| Version control | Restore any previous version, never lose work |
| API access | Connect with your existing tools automatically |

**Then lead with capabilities**, mention features as support.

**Resource**: Use `03-features-capabilities-benefits.md`

## MISTAKE #6: No Social Proof (or Weak Social Proof)

### The Problem

**Symptom**: No customer logos, testimonials, or case studies. Or generic testimonials like "Great product!"

**Why it fails**: Visitors need trust signals. Claims without proof = skepticism.

### Types of Weak Social Proof

**Weak testimonials**:
- "Amazing tool!" - Generic praise
- "Game changer" - Cliché, no specifics
- "Best product ever" - Unbelievable

**Weak logos**:
- Made-up company names
- Tiny companies nobody recognizes
- Very outdated customers

**No proof at all**:
- Just claims without validation
- "Trusted by thousands" (but no names)

### How to Fix It

**Strong social proof includes**:

**1. Recognizable customer logos** (8-12)
- Well-known brands
- Diverse (different industries/sizes)
- Recent customers (shows momentum)

**2. Specific testimonials**
- Quantified results: "We ship 2x faster"
- Name, title, company
- Photo (builds trust)
- Addresses specific pain point

**3. Case studies** (2-3 detailed)
- Before/after story
- Specific metrics
- Full customer journey

**4. Third-party validation**
- G2/Capterra ratings
- Industry awards
- Security certifications (if relevant)

**Example strong testimonial**:
"Since switching to Figma, our design-to-dev time dropped from 2 weeks to 3 days. The real-time collaboration eliminates all the back-and-forth." - Sarah Chen, Product Design Lead at Stripe

**Resource**: Use `social-proof-strategies.md` (advanced)

## MISTAKE #7: Targeting Executives When Users Visit

### The Problem

**Symptom**: Homepage written entirely for C-level (ROI, business outcomes) when end users are the ones visiting.

**Example messaging** (exec-focused):
- "Increase revenue by 30%"
- "Achieve strategic alignment"
- "Drive digital transformation"

**Why it fails**: The first visitor is usually an individual contributor (user), not a C-level executive. If users don't understand the product, they won't champion it internally.

### The Buying Journey

**Typical B2B SaaS buying journey**:
1. **User** discovers product (homepage visitor #1)
2. **User** tries product
3. **User** becomes champion
4. **Champion** convinces manager
5. **Manager** builds business case
6. **Executive** approves budget

**If your homepage loses the user (step 1)**, the chain breaks.

### How to Fix It

**Homepage strategy**:
- **Hero + value props**: Target users (capabilities, product clarity)
- **ROI section (below the fold)**: Target executives (business outcomes)
- **Separate pages**: Enterprise/business case page for executives

**Example fix**:

❌ **All executive-focused**:
Hero: "Drive 30% revenue growth and achieve digital transformation"

✅ **User-focused hero, exec content later**:
Hero: "Design in the same file with your team, get instant feedback, hand off perfect specs"

ROI Section (later on page): "Teams using Figma ship 2x faster and save $50K/year on design software"

**Resource**: Use `persona-specific-messaging.md` (advanced)

## MISTAKE #8: Overloading with Too Many Messages

### The Problem

**Symptom**: Trying to communicate 10+ value propositions on the homepage.

**Why it fails**: Dilutes focus. Visitors get overwhelmed and remember nothing.

### The Psychology

**Paradox of choice**: More options = harder to decide = lower conversion

**Focus = Memorability**: 3-5 clear value props > 15 scattered messages

### How to Fix It

**Choose your top 3-5 value propositions** for the homepage:

**Criteria for selection**:
1. Most differentiated
2. Most important to target audience
3. Most provable (social proof available)

**Put everything else**:
- Feature comparison page
- Documentation
- Blog posts
- Help center

**Example**:

❌ **Too many** (12 value props):
Collaboration, Security, Speed, Integrations, Mobile, Analytics, Automation, Scalability, Customization, Support, Compliance, AI-powered

**Visitor reaction**: Overwhelmed, remembers nothing

✅ **Focused** (3 value props):
1. Real-time collaboration
2. Instant feedback with commenting
3. Perfect dev handoff

**Visitor reaction**: Clear understanding of core value

**Resource**: Use `04-homepage-structure-flow.md` for value prop selection

## MISTAKE #9: No Clear Call to Action

### The Problem

**Symptom**: Unclear what action to take, or too many competing CTAs.

**Examples of confusion**:
- "Learn More" (to what?)
- "Get Started" vs "Try Free" vs "Book Demo" vs "Contact Sales" (which one?)
- No CTA at all
- CTA buried at bottom

### Why it fails

**Visitors need clear next step**. Ambiguity = inaction.

### How to Fix It

**Choose ONE primary CTA** based on your go-to-market motion:

**Product-Led Growth (PLG)**:
- Primary: "Start Free Trial" or "Get Started Free"
- Secondary: "Watch Demo"

**Sales-Led**:
- Primary: "Book a Demo" or "Talk to Sales"
- Secondary: "See How It Works"

**Hybrid**:
- Primary: "Try Free"
- Secondary: "Talk to Sales" (for enterprise)

**CTA best practices**:
- High-contrast button (stands out)
- Action-oriented copy (not "Submit")
- Remove friction ("No credit card required")
- Repeat CTA at top AND bottom

**Example**:

❌ **Unclear**:
Buttons: "Learn More" / "Explore" / "Discover" / "Read"

✅ **Clear**:
Primary: "Start Free Trial"
Secondary: "Watch 2-Min Demo"

## MISTAKE #10: Ignoring Mobile Experience

### The Problem

**Symptom**: Desktop-first design that breaks or is unusable on mobile.

**Why it matters**: 40-60% of B2B traffic is mobile (especially from social/email).

### Common mobile mistakes

**Text too small** to read
**Buttons too small** to tap
**Horizontal scrolling** required
**Desktop screenshots** impossible to see
**Forms** too complex for mobile

### How to Fix It

**Mobile-first approach**:
1. **Simplify messaging** (shorter headlines, less copy)
2. **Larger touch targets** (buttons, links)
3. **Vertical scrolling** only
4. **Mobile-optimized visuals** (crop screenshots for mobile)
5. **Simplified forms** (fewer fields)

**Test on real devices**:
- iPhone (small + large)
- Android
- Tablet

**Metrics to watch**:
- Mobile bounce rate (should be <70%)
- Mobile conversion rate (should be >50% of desktop)

**Resource**: Use `mobile-responsive-messaging.md` (advanced)

## MISTAKE #11: Not Testing with Real Customers

### The Problem

**Symptom**: Launching messaging based on internal opinions, not customer feedback.

**Why it fails**: What resonates internally often doesn't resonate with buyers.

### The Internal Echo Chamber

**Common internal mistakes**:
- Using jargon nobody outside the company understands
- Overvaluing features the team loves but customers don't care about
- Optimizing for executives instead of users

### How to Fix It

**Test BEFORE launch**:

**1. The 5-Second Test**
- Show homepage to 10+ target customers for 5 seconds
- Ask: "What does this company do?"
- If 8/10 can't answer: Rewrite and retest

**2. The Sales Pitch Test**
- Can your sales team explain positioning in 30 seconds using homepage language?
- If no: Messaging isn't clear enough

**3. The Customer Recognition Test**
- Show homepage to target customers
- Ask: "Is this for you?"
- If they don't immediately recognize themselves: Too broad

**Test AFTER launch**:
- Monitor bounce rate, time on site, conversion rate
- Run user testing sessions
- Review session recordings
- Survey visitors

**Resource**: Use `12-testing-validation.md` for full testing methodology

## MISTAKE #12: A/B Testing Positioning Decisions

### The Problem

**Symptom**: Using A/B tests to choose between fundamentally different target segments.

**Example**:
- Variant A: "For enterprise sales teams"
- Variant B: "For SMB marketing teams"

**Why it fails**: If your GTM and traffic are focused on segment A, messaging for segment B will always lose—not because segment B is bad, but because segment B isn't visiting your site.

### The Pierri Insight

**Quote**: "Which segment converts better on a homepage is a terrible indicator of which segment is better overall for your company."

**Why**: Your current traffic, content, and distribution already target segment A. Of course messaging for A will outperform B in an A/B test.

### When A/B Testing DOES Work

**Good use cases for homepage A/B tests**:
- Testing messaging variations within same positioning (e.g., H1 variations)
- Testing CTA copy ("Start Free" vs "Try Free")
- Testing social proof placement
- Testing value prop order
- Testing visual vs no visual

**Bad use cases**:
- Choosing between target segments
- Choosing between product categories
- Making fundamental positioning decisions

### How to Fix It

**For positioning decisions**: Use qualitative research, not A/B tests
- Customer interviews
- Sales conversations
- Message testing (Wynter, UserTesting)
- Market analysis

**For optimization decisions**: Use A/B tests
- Headline variations
- CTA copy and placement
- Value prop presentation
- Visual elements

**Resource**: Use `12-testing-validation.md` for when to A/B test vs when to use other methods
