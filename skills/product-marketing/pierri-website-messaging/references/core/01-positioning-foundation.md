## What is Positioning?

Positioning is **defining your product in the minds of your target customers**. It clearly communicates:
- What your product does
- Who it's for
- Why it's better than the alternatives

**Positioning is NOT marketing fluff.** It's strategic clarity that drives every customer-facing message.

---

## The Foundational Formula

```
TARGET CUSTOMER + DIFFERENTIATION = POSITIONING
```

This simple formula is the foundation of all effective positioning:

1. **Target Customer**: The specific segment most likely to buy
2. **Differentiation**: What makes you uniquely valuable to them

**Example**:
- **Target Customer**: Design teams at tech companies
- **Differentiation**: Real-time collaborative editing
- **Positioning**: Figma = "The collaborative interface design tool"

---

## The Four Positioning Questions

Every homepage must answer these four questions, ideally in the hero section:

### 1. Who is it for?
- **Target customer segment** (industry, company size, role)
- **Persona** (specific buyer or user)
- **Use case** (what they're trying to accomplish)

**Good examples**:
- "For construction companies" (Procore)
- "For design teams" (Figma)
- "For anyone scheduling meetings" (Calendly)

**Bad examples**:
- "For innovative companies" (too vague)
- "For teams that want to work better" (everyone wants this)

### 2. What is it?
- **Product category** OR **use case description**
- Helps visitors instantly understand context

**Good examples**:
- "Issue tracking tool" (Linear)
- "Interface design tool" (Figma)
- "Send a video message instead of a meeting" (Loom - use case)

**Bad examples**:
- "Collaboration platform" (what KIND of collaboration?)
- "All-in-one solution" (for what?)

### 3. What makes it different?
- **Unique capability** your product offers
- **Binary differentiation** (you have it, competitors don't)
- **Specific approach** that sets you apart

**Good examples**:
- "Real-time collaboration" (Figma, when competitors had none)
- "We don't track you" (DuckDuckGo vs Chrome)
- "Issue tracking you'll enjoy using" (Linear vs Jira)

**Bad examples**:
- "Better user experience" (subjective, everyone claims it)
- "AI-powered" (unless that's truly unique)
- "Enterprise-grade" (vague)

### 4. Why does it matter?
- **Value** delivered to the target customer
- **Outcome** achieved through differentiation
- **Specific benefit** tied to capabilities

**Good examples**:
- "Ship products faster" (from better collaboration)
- "Protect your privacy" (from not tracking)
- "Stop dreading your issue tracker" (from better UX)

**Bad examples**:
- "Increase productivity" (generic)
- "Drive growth" (too vague)
- "Transform your business" (meaningless)

## Minimum Viable Positioning (MVP)

You don't need perfect positioning to get started. You need **Minimum Viable Positioning**:

### The Three Components of MVP

1. **Minimum**: Take at least a STAB at what market segment will benefit most
2. **Viable**: Figure out ENOUGH to craft a message and test if anyone cares
3. **Positioning**: Actually USE it in an asset and show it to real potential customers

### The Minimum Requirement

You need **at least 2 elements** to start:
- **One from the product side**: What it is OR what makes it different
- **One from the market side**: Who it's for OR what use case

**MVP Examples**:

✅ **Good MVP**:
- "Issue tracking [WHAT] for software teams [WHO]"
- "Real-time collaborative design [DIFFERENT] for remote teams [WHO]"
- "Skip the meeting [USE CASE], send a video [WHAT]"

❌ **Insufficient**:
- "Better software" (no WHO, vague WHAT)
- "For marketing teams" (WHO but no WHAT or DIFFERENT)

### When to Upgrade Your MVP

Start with MVP, then iterate as you learn:
- **Week 1-4**: Launch with MVP positioning, gather feedback
- **Month 2-3**: Refine based on which segments respond best
- **Month 4-6**: Add more nuance and depth
- **Ongoing**: Continuous refinement as market evolves

**Don't wait for perfect positioning.** Perfect is the enemy of shipped.

## Two Positioning Approaches

Choose your reference point to anchor your product:

### Approach 1: Category-Based Positioning

Position within an **existing product category** and differentiate yourself.

**Structure**: "The [DIFFERENTIATION] [CATEGORY]"

**When to use**:
- Clear, known category exists (CRM, project management, design tools)
- You have direct competitors buyers already know
- Buyers are actively searching for solutions in that category
- You can claim meaningful differentiation within the category

**Examples**:
- Figma: "The collaborative interface design tool"
- Linear: "The issue tracking tool you'll enjoy using"
- Arc Browser: "The Chrome replacement"

**Pros**:
- Instant comprehension (buyers know the category)
- Easy to communicate differentiation
- Fits existing buyer search behavior

**Cons**:
- Must be clearly different from competitors
- Tied to category perceptions (good and bad)
- Harder if category is crowded/commoditized

### Approach 2: Use Case-Based Positioning

Position around a **specific workflow or problem** your product solves.

**Structure**: "We help you [USE CASE]" or "[USE CASE] done [DIFFERENT WAY]"

**When to use**:
- Emerging category without clear definition
- Product serves multiple verticals with one core use case
- The workflow/problem is more intuitive than category name
- You want to avoid category baggage

**Examples**:
- Loom: "Skip the meeting, send a Loom"
- Calendly: Focus on "scheduling meetings" use case
- SmallPDF: "Shrink PDFs" use case

**Pros**:
- Highly relatable (everyone understands use cases)
- Avoids competitive comparison fatigue
- Works well for novel/emerging products

**Cons**:
- May need to explain "how" (what category is it?)
- Risk being too narrow in perception
- Less discoverable via category search

### Hybrid Approach (Advanced)

Combine both for comprehensive clarity:

**Hero H1**: Use case
**Hero H2**: Category + differentiation

**Example**:
- **H1**: "Skip the meeting, send a Loom"
- **H2**: "The async video messaging tool for distributed teams"

**When to use**:
- You have strong use case AND clear category
- Homepage has room for both without confusion
- Target audience needs both contexts

## Positioning: Target Customer + Differentiation

Let's break down each half of the formula:

### Part 1: Target Customer

**Three levels of specificity**:

1. **Broad**: Industry or company type
   - "Construction companies"
   - "Tech startups"
   - "E-commerce brands"

2. **Specific**: Persona or role
   - "Design teams"
   - "Sales managers"
   - "CFOs at mid-market companies"

3. **Hyper-specific**: Persona + context + use case
   - "Design teams at remote-first tech companies building SaaS products"
   - "Sales managers at SMB companies selling to enterprise"

**Guidance**:
- Early stage: Be hyper-specific (level 3)
- Growth stage: Can broaden to level 2
- Scale stage: Sometimes level 1 is enough if differentiation is clear

### Part 2: Differentiation

**Three types of differentiation**:

1. **Capability-based**: You do something competitors can't
   - "Real-time collaboration" (Figma, when others were file-based)
   - "Don't track you" (DuckDuckGo vs Chrome)

2. **Approach-based**: You do it differently/better
   - "Issue tracking you'll enjoy using" (Linear vs Jira)
   - "Visual project management" (Notion vs Word)

3. **Segment-based**: You're built for a specific segment
   - "Built for construction" (Procore)
   - "Designed for remote teams" (Remote-first tools)

**Test your differentiation**:
✅ **Good**: Can you say "Unlike [competitor], we [differentiation]"?
✅ **Good**: Is it specific and provable?
❌ **Bad**: Could any competitor claim the same thing?
❌ **Bad**: Is it subjective without proof?

## Horizontal vs Vertical SaaS Positioning

The type of SaaS you're building fundamentally affects your positioning approach.

### Vertical SaaS

**Definition**: Product focused on one specific industry, persona, or company type, solving multiple problems for that segment.

**Example**: Procore (construction management software)

**Positioning advantages**:
- ✅ Easier messaging (WHO is answered by default)
- ✅ Clear distribution channels (go where your segment hangs out)
- ✅ Natural customer-centricity (deep segment understanding)

**Positioning challenges**:
- ⚠️ Requires deep industry expertise
- ⚠️ Smaller TAM (limited to one vertical)
- ⚠️ Must prove vertical-specific value

**Positioning structure**:
```
"The [CATEGORY] for [VERTICAL]"
"We help [VERTICAL] [ACHIEVE OUTCOME]"
```

Examples:
- "Construction management software for general contractors"
- "We help law firms manage cases and clients"

### Horizontal SaaS

**Definition**: Product serving multiple industries with the SAME use case and SAME vocabulary across all segments.

**Example**: Calendly (scheduling for everyone), Slack (team communication for all)

**Positioning advantages**:
- ✅ Larger TAM (multiple industries)
- ✅ Can expand to new segments easily
- ✅ Network effects possible

**Positioning challenges**:
- ⚠️ Harder to choose WHO to target
- ⚠️ Must appeal to diverse personas
- ⚠️ Distribution less obvious

**Critical requirement**: All industries must use the **SAME WORDS** to describe the use case.

**Positioning structure**:
```
"[CAPABILITY/USE CASE] for [BROAD SEGMENT]"
"The [CATEGORY] for teams of all sizes"
```

Examples:
- "Schedule meetings without the back-and-forth" (Calendly)
- "Team communication for the modern workplace" (Slack)

### The Gray Area: Pseudo-Horizontal

**Warning**: If industries use DIFFERENT words for functionally similar tasks, you're NOT horizontal—you're a collection of vertical solutions.

**Example**:
- Legal case management
- Real estate transaction management
- Healthcare patient management

→ Functionally similar, but each industry uses completely different vocabulary. This is NOT horizontal; it's three vertical products.

**How to tell**:
- ✅ **Horizontal**: Everyone calls it "scheduling meetings"
- ❌ **Pseudo-horizontal**: Lawyers say "case management," real estate says "transaction management," healthcare says "patient management"

**Implication**: If you're pseudo-horizontal, pick ONE vertical for your homepage and create separate landing pages for others.

## Choosing Your Positioning Approach: Decision Framework

Use this decision tree to choose your approach:

### Step 1: Identify Your SaaS Type

**Are you Horizontal or Vertical?**

→ **Vertical** (one industry/segment): Go to Step 2A
→ **Horizontal** (multiple industries, same vocabulary): Go to Step 2B

### Step 2A: Vertical SaaS Positioning

**Is there a clear category in your vertical?**

→ **Yes** (e.g., "construction management software" exists):
   - Use category-based positioning
   - "The [DIFFERENTIATION] [CATEGORY] for [VERTICAL]"
   - Example: "The mobile-first construction management platform"

→ **No** (emerging category):
   - Use use case-based positioning
   - "We help [VERTICAL] [DO USE CASE]"
   - Example: "Help general contractors track projects in the field"

### Step 2B: Horizontal SaaS Positioning

**Which is stronger: your use case or your category?**

→ **Use case is clear and universal**:
   - Lead with use case
   - "Help teams [USE CASE]"
   - Example: "Schedule meetings without the back-and-forth"

→ **Category is well-known**:
   - Use category-based positioning
   - "The [DIFFERENTIATION] [CATEGORY]"
   - Example: "The collaborative design platform"

→ **Both are strong**:
   - Use hybrid approach
   - H1: Use case, H2: Category + differentiation

### Step 3: Test Your Positioning

**Answer these questions**:

1. Can a visitor understand what you do in 5 seconds? (YES/NO)
2. Is your target customer clear? (YES/NO)
3. Is your differentiation specific and provable? (YES/NO)
4. Would prospects recognize themselves in your messaging? (YES/NO)

**If you answered NO to any**: Revisit your positioning using this guide.

## Common Positioning Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Refusing to Choose a Target Customer

**Problem**: "We're for everyone" or "Any company can use us"

**Why it fails**: Generic messaging resonates with no one. Trying to speak to everyone means you differentiate for no one.

**Fix**: Pick 1-2 segments to focus on for the next 6-12 months. You can expand later.

**Example**:
- ❌ Bad: "For any team that wants to collaborate better"
- ✅ Good: "For design teams at tech companies"

### ❌ Mistake 2: Vague or Subjective Differentiation

**Problem**: "Better UX," "More intuitive," "Enterprise-grade"

**Why it fails**: Everyone claims these. Not provable. No specificity.

**Fix**: Find binary differentiation—something you have that competitors literally don't.

**Example**:
- ❌ Bad: "The most intuitive design tool"
- ✅ Good: "The only design tool with real-time multiplayer editing"

### ❌ Mistake 3: Creating a New Category Without Massive Budget

**Problem**: Inventing new category names instead of using familiar ones

**Why it fails**: Even Slack ($100M+ marketing) couldn't get people to say "collaboration hub" instead of "chat app."

**Fix**: Use existing categories buyers understand. Differentiate within them.

**Example**:
- ❌ Bad: "The customer insight orchestration platform" (made-up category)
- ✅ Good: "Survey software with AI-powered analysis"

### ❌ Mistake 4: Mixing Vertical and Horizontal

**Problem**: Trying to serve both broad use case AND specific industry

**Why it fails**: Creates message confusion. Can't narrow enough to resonate.

**Fix**: Choose one. If you serve multiple industries, create separate landing pages.

**Example**:
- ❌ Bad: "Project management for construction, marketing, and IT teams"
- ✅ Good: "Construction project management" (vertical) OR "Project management for distributed teams" (horizontal)

### ❌ Mistake 5: Leading with Vision, Not Product

**Problem**: "Transforming the future of work" or "Reimagining collaboration"

**Why it fails**: Buyers want to know what it IS before they care about your vision.

**Fix**: Start with clear positioning (what it is, who it's for). Vision comes later.

**Example**:
- ❌ Bad: "Reimagining how teams create together"
- ✅ Good: "The collaborative design tool for remote teams"

- **Differentiation**: You'll enjoy using it (UX focus)
- **Why it matters**: Addresses Jira pain (everyone hates Jira)

**Why it works**:
- Category is clear
- Plays on known competitor pain (Jira UX)
- Simple differentiation claim
- Target audience immediately gets it

**Approach**: Category-based positioning with emotional hook

### Example 4: DuckDuckGo

**Positioning**: "The Internet privacy company" / "Unlike Chrome and other browsers, we don't track you"

**Breakdown**:
- **What**: Browser/search engine (category)
- **Who**: Privacy-conscious users
- **Differentiation**: We don't track you (binary)
- **Why it matters**: Protect your privacy

**Why it works**:
- Binary differentiation (track vs don't track)
- Names the competitor (Chrome)
- Clear value for privacy-conscious users
- Easy to verify/trust

**Approach**: Category-based with binary differentiation
