## The Proven Homepage Flow

Based on 400+ positioning projects, FletchPMM has identified the optimal homepage structure for B2B SaaS:

```
HERO → PROBLEM → SOLUTION → VALUE PROPOSITIONS → SOCIAL PROOF → CTA
```

**Typical sections in order**:

1. **Hero Section** (above the fold)
2. **Problem Section** (articulate the pain)
3. **Solution Introduction** (introduce your product)
4. **Value Proposition Sections** (3-5 major capabilities)
5. **Social Proof** (logos, testimonials, case studies)
6. **Call to Action** (demo, signup, contact)

**Optional sections** (add as needed):
- How It Works
- Integrations
- Pricing Preview
- FAQ
- Final CTA

---

## Section 1: Hero Section (Above the Fold)

**Purpose**: Answer the four positioning questions immediately.

**Required elements**:
- H1 headline
- H2 supporting copy
- Primary CTA
- Visual (product screenshot, illustration, or demo)

**Optional elements**:
- Customer logos
- Trust badges (security, compliance)
- Video or animated demo

### Hero H1: What Goes Here?

**The H1 must answer**: What is this product?

**Three proven approaches**:

#### Approach 1: Category + Differentiation

**Structure**: "The [DIFFERENTIATION] [CATEGORY]"

**Examples**:
- "The collaborative interface design tool" (Figma)
- "The issue tracking tool you'll enjoy using" (Linear)
- "The Chrome replacement for people who live on the internet" (Arc)

**When to use**:
- Clear category exists
- Differentiation is obvious
- Target audience knows the category

#### Approach 2: Use Case

**Structure**: "Help [WHO] [DO WHAT]" or "[DO WHAT] [HOW/DIFFERENTLY]"

**Examples**:
- "Skip the meeting, send a Loom"
- "Scheduling automation for teams"
- "Design systems that scale"

**When to use**:
- Use case is more intuitive than category
- Multiple verticals, one use case
- Want to avoid category baggage

#### Approach 3: Core Capability

**Structure**: "[PRIMARY CAPABILITY]" or "[VERB PHRASE]"

**Examples**:
- "Design, collaborate, and build products together" (Figma alternative)
- "Build better products faster"
- "Manage your entire business in one place"

**When to use**:
- Primary capability is self-explanatory
- Capability IS the differentiation
- Strong, clear verb phrases

### Hero H2: Supporting Copy

**Purpose**: Add context and expand on the H1.

**Three proven patterns**:

#### Pattern 1: Target Audience + Expanded Capability

**Structure**: "[FOR WHO] who want to [CAPABILITY/OUTCOME]"

**Examples**:
- "For design teams who want to collaborate in real-time and ship faster"
- "Built for sales teams that need visibility into every deal"
- "The project management tool for remote teams who hate meetings"

#### Pattern 2: Problem → Solution

**Structure**: "Instead of [PROBLEM/ALTERNATIVE], [CAPABILITY]"

**Examples**:
- "Instead of email back-and-forth, schedule meetings with a link"
- "Stop juggling spreadsheets and start managing projects visually"
- "Replace expensive agencies with self-service design automation"

#### Pattern 3: Key Capabilities List

**Structure**: "[CAPABILITY 1], [CAPABILITY 2], and [CAPABILITY 3]"

**Examples**:
- "Create, collaborate, and ship—all in one tool"
- "Track deals, forecast revenue, and coach your team"
- "Design interfaces, build prototypes, and hand off to developers seamlessly"

### Hero CTA: What Action?

**Primary CTA options** (pick one):

1. **"Get Started Free"** - For product-led growth (PLG)
2. **"Book a Demo"** - For sales-led
3. **"Try It Free"** - For free trial
4. **"See How It Works"** - For demo video/tour
5. **"Request Access"** - For waitlist/beta

**Secondary CTA** (optional):
- "Watch Demo" (if primary is "Get Started")
- "Contact Sales" (if primary is "Try Free")

**CTA best practices**:
- Use high-contrast button
- Keep copy short (2-3 words)
- Remove friction (no "Schedule" if you mean "Book Demo")
- Make it outcome-oriented when possible

### Hero Visual: Show the Product

**Options**:

1. **Product screenshot** (most common)
   - Show the actual interface
   - Highlight key features
   - Use realistic data, not "lorem ipsum"

2. **Animated demo** (higher engagement)
   - Show key workflow in action
   - Keep it short (5-10 seconds)
   - Loop seamlessly

3. **Illustration** (abstract/conceptual)
   - Use when product is complex
   - Visualize the use case
   - Only if screenshot isn't compelling

**Best practice**: Real product screenshot > Everything else

---

## Section 2: Problem Section

**Purpose**: Articulate the pain of the current alternative.

**Why this matters**: People buy to solve problems. Surfacing the pain makes your solution more valuable.

### Structure Options

#### Option 1: "The Old Way" Contrast

**Structure**: "If you're using [ALTERNATIVE], you know the pain:"

**Example**:
```
Still using Sketch + Dropbox?

❌ Version control nightmares
❌ Can't collaborate in real-time
❌ Feedback takes days, not minutes
❌ Dev handoff is a manual mess
```

#### Option 2: Day-in-the-Life

**Structure**: "Here's what your day looks like with [ALTERNATIVE]:"

**Example**:
```
Your typical day:
• 8am: Check email for meeting requests
• 9am: Send 5 "what time works?" emails
• 11am: Check responses, suggest new times
• 2pm: Finally confirm a meeting... for next week
• Repeat 10x per week

Sound familiar?
```

#### Option 3: Quantified Pain

**Structure**: "Teams waste [X TIME/MONEY] on [PROBLEM]"

**Example**:
```
The real cost of manual scheduling:

• 5+ hours per week on email back-and-forth
• 23% of meetings never get scheduled
• Sales reps lose hot leads to scheduling delays
```

### Problem Section Best Practices

✅ **Do**:
- Be specific (not "collaboration is hard" but "can't see what teammates are working on")
- Use customer language (pull from interviews)
- Quantify when possible (hours wasted, money lost)
- Make it relatable (target audience should nod along)

❌ **Don't**:
- Make it too negative/depressing
- Attack competitors by name (be classy)
- Spend too long here (3-5 pain points max)
- Use made-up problems

---

## Section 3: Solution Introduction

**Purpose**: Introduce your product as the answer to the problems.

**Typical structure**:

1. **Transition statement**: "There's a better way"
2. **Product introduction**: Brief overview
3. **Key differentiators**: What makes you different
4. **Transition to value props**: "Here's how"

### Example - Figma-style

```
**There's a better way**

Figma brings your entire design workflow into one tool—no more scattered files, no more waiting for feedback, no more broken handoffs.

With real-time collaboration built in from day one, your team can design together, iterate faster, and ship products that your developers can actually build.

Here's how Figma transforms your workflow:
```

### Example - Calendly-style

```
**Say goodbye to scheduling hassles**

Calendly eliminates the back-and-forth emails. Just share your link, and people can book time directly on your calendar based on your real availability.

It works with Google Calendar, Outlook, and everything else you use—so you're never double-booked and never miss a meeting.

See how simple it is:
```

### Solution Intro Best Practices

**Keep it brief**: 2-3 short paragraphs max. The value prop sections go deeper.

**What to include**:
- How you solve the problem
- What makes you different
- A taste of key capabilities (full details come next)

**What to avoid**:
- Repeating the hero H1/H2 verbatim
- Generic claims without specifics
- Too much detail (save for value props)

---

## Section 4: Value Proposition Sections

**Purpose**: Deep dive on your 3-5 main capabilities and how they deliver value.

**How many value props?** 3-5 major ones. More than that dilutes focus.

### Structure for Each Value Prop

```
[VALUE PROP TITLE]
Capability-focused headline (4-8 words)

[VISUAL]
Product screenshot showing this capability

[DESCRIPTION]
2-3 sentences explaining the capability

[FEATURE CALLOUTS] (optional)
Bullet points of specific features

[BENEFIT STATEMENT]
Clear outcome delivered

[SOCIAL PROOF] (optional)
Customer quote validating this value prop
```

### Example Value Prop Section - Figma

```
**Real-Time Collaboration**

Design together, no matter where you are

[Screenshot: Multiple cursors in a Figma file]

Your entire team can work in the same file simultaneously. See exactly what everyone is working on with live cursors and updates. No more "Can I edit now?" or version control nightmares.

• Unlimited editors at any plan level
• Real-time cursor tracking and presence
• Conflict-free editing with automatic sync
• Comment directly on designs with @mentions

Ship features 2x faster by eliminating handoff delays and review cycles.

"We cut our design-to-dev time in half."
- Sarah Chen, Design Lead at Stripe
```

### Value Prop Pattern Options

#### Pattern 1: Capability-Feature-Benefit (Recommended)

1. **Headline**: Core capability
2. **Description**: What you can do
3. **Features**: How it works
4. **Benefit**: Outcome achieved

**Best for**: Technical products, informed buyers

#### Pattern 2: Problem-Solution

1. **Headline**: Problem you solve
2. **Description**: How you solve it
3. **Features**: Key capabilities
4. **Benefit**: Life after

**Best for**: Obvious pain points, relatable problems

#### Pattern 3: Before-After

1. **Headline**: "No more [PROBLEM]"
2. **Before**: Old way
3. **After**: New way with your product
4. **Benefit**: What changes

**Best for**: Strong alternative to position against

### Visual Hierarchy for Value Props

**Layout patterns**:

1. **Alternating** (most common)
   - Left: Text, Right: Visual
   - Right: Text, Left: Visual
   - Repeat

2. **Consistent side**
   - Always: Left: Text, Right: Visual
   - Creates rhythm

3. **Full-width**
   - Text above, visual below
   - Good for workflow/process shots

**Visual types**:
- Product screenshots (best)
- Annotated screenshots (great for complex features)
- Short GIFs/animations (high engagement)
- Diagrams (for abstract concepts)

---

## Section 5: Social Proof

**Purpose**: Build trust and validate your claims.

**What to include**:

### Customer Logos

**Best practices**:
- 8-12 recognizable brands
- Show diversity (different industries/sizes)
- Update regularly (fresh logos signal momentum)
- Don't lie (only real customers)

**Section title options**:
- "Trusted by leading teams at..."
- "Powering design at..."
- "Join 10,000+ teams including..."

### Testimonials

**Types**:

1. **Quote testimonials**
   - 1-2 sentences
   - Name, title, company
   - Photo (optional but better)

2. **Full case studies**
   - Customer story
   - Problem, solution, results
   - Quantified outcomes

3. **Video testimonials** (highest trust)
   - 30-60 second clips
   - Customer speaks directly to camera
   - Real person, real story

**What makes a good testimonial**:
✅ **Specific**: "We ship 2x faster" not "Great product"
✅ **Quantified**: "Saved 10 hours/week" not "Saved time"
✅ **Addresses objections**: "Easy to onboard our team" if that's a concern
✅ **Relatable**: From a persona your visitors recognize

❌ **Bad testimonials**:
- "Amazing product!" (vague)
- "Game changer" (cliché)
- "Best tool ever" (unbelievable)

### Social Proof Placement

**Option 1**: Dedicated section after value props
**Option 2**: Integrated into value prop sections (quote per value prop)
**Option 3**: Both (logos early, detailed testimonials later)

---

## Section 6: Call to Action

**Purpose**: Convert visitors into users/leads.

### CTA Section Elements

1. **Headline**: Clear outcome
2. **Supporting copy**: Why now
3. **CTA button**: Main action
4. **Trust elements**: Reduce friction

**Example**:

```
**Ready to design better products, faster?**

Join 50,000+ design teams already using Figma.
Get started free—no credit card required.

[Get Started Free]

### Reducing CTA Friction

**Friction reducers**:
- "No credit card required"
- "Free forever" (if true)
- "Cancel anytime"
- "2-minute setup"
- "Import your data with one click"

**Social proof boosters**:
- "Join [X] companies using [product]"

## Common Homepage Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Unclear Hero

**Problem**: Visitor can't tell what the product is in 5 seconds.

**Examples**:
- "Transform the future of work" (what IS it?)
- "Collaborate better" (what product category?)
- "Built for teams" (what teams? what does it do?)

**Fix**: Use category or use case in H1.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Too Many Value Props

**Problem**: Listing 10+ capabilities dilutes focus.

**Fix**: Choose 3-5 most important. Link to feature page for full list.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Features Without Context

**Problem**: Listing features without explaining capabilities or benefits.

**Example**: "Real-time sync, cloud storage, API access" (so what?)

**Fix**: Connect features to capabilities and benefits.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Generic Claims

**Problem**: Saying things every competitor says.

**Examples**: "Easy to use," "Powerful," "Enterprise-grade"

**Fix**: Be specific. Show don't tell.

### ❌ Mistake 5: No Social Proof

**Problem**: Asking for trust without earning it.

**Fix**: Add logos, testimonials, case studies, review site ratings.

### ❌ Mistake 6: Confusing Flow

**Problem**: Sections in random order, no logical progression.

**Fix**: Follow the proven flow: Hero → Problem → Solution → Value → Proof → CTA.
