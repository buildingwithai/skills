# Messaging Canvas Template

**Based on**: Anthony Pierri's Periodic Table of Messaging Elements
**Purpose**: Complete worksheet for foundational messaging elements

---

## Instructions

Fill out this canvas **left-to-right, top-to-bottom** like a user story map.

Start with market context (who you're targeting), then map the current state (before your product), then define what changes with your product.

**Key principle**: Create linkages between elements
- Capabilities should address Problems
- Features should enable Capabilities
- Benefits should result from Capabilities

---

## SECTION 1: Market Context

## NEXT STEPS

Once you've completed this canvas:

1. **Create your homepage structure** → Use `homepage-flow-template.md`
2. **Develop your hero section** → Use `hero-section-template.md`
3. **Build out value prop sections** → Use `value-proposition-canvas.md`
4. **Test your messaging** → Use `clarity-test-30-seconds.md`

**Keep this canvas as a living document.** Update it as you learn more about your customers and as your product evolves.
