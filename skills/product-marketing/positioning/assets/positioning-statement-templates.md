**The new way**: ___________________________________________________________

**When** ___________________________________________________________________

**I want to** ______________________________________________________________

**So I can** _______________________________________________________________

**But current solutions** ___________________________________________________

**[Product name] helps by** ________________________________________________

---

### Example: Intercom (Customer Messaging)

**When** a new user signs up or a customer needs help

**I want to** communicate with them at exactly the right moment with the right message

**So I can** onboard them successfully or solve their problem before they churn

**But current solutions** (email, live chat, help desk) are separate tools with no context

**Intercom helps by** unifying all customer communication in one platform with complete context and automation

## Multi-Format Example: Gong

### April Dunford Format

**For** B2B sales leaders with 10+ reps

**Who** struggle with inconsistent forecasts and can't coach effectively because they don't know what's happening in deals

**Gong** is a **revenue intelligence platform**

**That** captures and analyzes every customer conversation to surface risks, opportunities, and coaching moments

**Unlike** relying on CRM updates, gut feel, or listening to random call recordings

**We** automatically record 100% of calls, meetings, and emails, then use AI to show you exactly what's working and what's not across every deal

---

### Simple Value Prop

**We help** B2B sales leaders

**Turn** every customer conversation into actionable intelligence

**By** automatically capturing and analyzing all calls, meetings, and emails using AI

**So they can** forecast accurately, coach effectively, and win more deals

---

### Comparison-Based

**If you've tried** relying on CRM notes and sales rep updates to understand what's happening in deals

**But found** information is inconsistent, outdated, or missing entirely

**Gong is** a revenue intelligence platform that automatically captures every customer interaction

**Which means** you finally have complete visibility into every deal without depending on rep data entry

---

### PAS Format

**B2B sales leaders** face invisible pipeline problems - they don't know why deals stall or what top reps do differently

**This leads to** inaccurate forecasts, missed quotas, and ineffective coaching based on assumptions

**Gong solves this by** recording and analyzing 100% of customer conversations to reveal exactly what's happening in deals

**So they can** spot risks early, replicate what works, and improve win rates across the team

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing your positioning statement, validate:

### Clarity
☐ **Can someone unfamiliar with your product understand it?**
☐ **No jargon or buzzwords** (unless industry-standard)
☐ **Concrete, specific language** (not vague or abstract)

### Differentiation
☐ **Clearly different from alternatives** (couldn't be said by competitors)
☐ **Unique capabilities mentioned** (not generic features)
☐ **Defensible claims** (provable, not just marketing fluff)

### Relevance
☐ **Addresses real customer pain** (from actual customer interviews)
☐ **Value is meaningful** (not "nice to have" but "must have")
☐ **Resonates with ICP** (uses their language and priorities)

### Strategy
☐ **Guides decision-making** (helps prioritize what to build/say/do)
☐ **Sets boundaries** (clear what you're NOT)
☐ **Aligns with capabilities** (you can actually deliver this)

### Completeness
☐ **Target customer specified** (not "everyone")
☐ **Alternatives identified** (know what you're competing against)
☐ **Value articulated** (benefit, not just features)
☐ **Differentiation clear** (why you vs alternatives)
☐ **Market category chosen** (context that makes value obvious)

---

## Testing Your Positioning Statement

**Before rolling out**, test with:

### Internal Test (1-2 hours)

**Sales team**:
- "Does this match who you win with?"
- "Can you explain the value in your own words?"
- "Does this help you compete?"

**Customer Success**:
- "Does this match successful customers?"
- "Would customers describe themselves this way?"

**Product**:
- "Can we deliver on these claims?"
- "Does this guide our roadmap?"

**Leadership**:
- "Does this align with strategy?"
- "Can we win here?"

---

### External Test (Recommended)

**Customer interviews** (10-15 customers):
- Read positioning statement
- "Does this resonate with why you bought?"
- "Would you describe us this way?"
- "What would you change?"

**Wynter testing** ($899, 12-48 hours):
- Test with verified ICP professionals
- Measure: Clarity (4.0+/5), Relevance (3.5+/5), Value (3.5+/5)
- Get qualitative feedback on every element

**Prospect interviews** (5-10 prospects):
- Show positioning-based messaging
- "Does this make sense for your situation?"
- "How is this different from alternatives?"
- "Would you want to learn more?"

---

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Too Broad
**Problem**: "For businesses who want to grow..."
**Fix**: "For B2B SaaS companies with 50-200 employees in high-growth phase..."

### 2. Feature-Focused
**Problem**: "We have AI, automation, and integrations..."
**Fix**: "We eliminate 10 hours of manual work per week by automating..."

### 3. Me-Too Positioning
**Problem**: "We're an all-in-one platform for sales teams..."
**Fix**: "Unlike all-in-one platforms that require adoption of entire suite, we integrate with your existing stack..."

### 4. Vague Value
**Problem**: "That helps you work more efficiently..."
**Fix**: "That cuts forecast prep time from 10 hours to 30 minutes per week..."

### 5. No Alternatives
**Problem**: Only lists competitive advantages, doesn't say vs what
**Fix**: Clearly states "Unlike [alternatives], we..."

### 6. Wrong Category
**Problem**: Positions in category where you're not credibly the best
**Fix**: Choose category/subcategory where you can win

## From Positioning to Messaging

**Positioning statements are internal**. Now create external messaging:

### Positioning → Messaging Translation

| Positioning Element | Becomes (Messaging) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Target customer | Buyer personas, audience targeting |
| Situation/pain | Problem statements, pain points |
| Differentiated value | Value propositions, benefit statements |
| Unique capabilities | Feature messaging, product descriptions |
| Competitive alternatives | Competitive battlecards, comparison pages |
| Market category | Category education content, market landscape |
| Proof points | Case studies, testimonials, stats |

**Next step**: Use messaging skill to translate positioning into customer-facing messages.

---

## Positioning Statement Evolution

**Positioning should evolve as**:
- You dominate beachhead and expand to new segments
- Product capabilities change significantly
- Market category shifts
- New competitors emerge
- Customer needs evolve

**Review quarterly**:
☐ Is our target customer still accurate?
☐ Are competitive alternatives the same?
☐ Is our differentiation still unique?
☐ Does value resonate as strongly?
☐ Is market category still optimal?

**Update positioning when**:
- ✅ Win rates decline with ICP
- ✅ Deals consistently go to new competitor
- ✅ Customer needs have shifted
- ✅ You've added major new capabilities
- ✅ Market category is evolving
- ❌ Someone just thinks we should (not data-driven)
