# Competitive Alternatives Map Template

Visual mapping tool for identifying and analyzing what customers would use if your product didn't exist.

## Overview

**Purpose**: Map the complete landscape of alternatives - not just direct competitors, but all the ways customers might solve their problem without you.

**Why this matters**: Most positioning fails because teams only look at direct competitors. Your real competition might be:
- Status quo ("do nothing" - wins 40% of B2B deals)
- Spreadsheets and DIY solutions
- Manual processes
- Indirect solutions from different categories

**Based on**: April Dunford's competitive alternatives framework + Wynter 2024 research showing status quo is the #1 competitor

**Time to complete**: 1-2 hours initial mapping, ongoing refinement

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Brainstorm All Alternatives (15 minutes)

List EVERYTHING customers might do instead of buying your product:

**Direct Competitors**:
- Products that look exactly like yours
- Same category, same features

**Indirect Competitors**:
- Different solutions to the same problem
- Other categories that overlap

**Status Quo**:
- What they do today without any solution
- "Do nothing" option

**DIY/Manual Solutions**:
- Spreadsheets
- Homegrown tools
- Manual processes
- Duct-taped tools together

**Example (for project management software)**:
- Direct: Asana, Monday.com, Jira, ClickUp
- Indirect: Notion, Airtable (databases), Slack (coordination)
- Status Quo: Email threads, meetings, verbal coordination
- DIY: Spreadsheets, Google Docs, Trello + 5 other tools

---

### Step 2: Validate with Customer Data (30 minutes)

Don't guess - ask customers and prospects:

**Questions to ask**:
1. "What were you using before you found us?"
2. "If we went away tomorrow, what would you use instead?"
3. "What other solutions did you evaluate when buying?"
4. "How did you solve this problem 2 years ago?"
5. "What almost prevented you from buying?"

**Where to find answers**:
- Win/loss interview transcripts
- Sales call recordings (Gong, Chorus)
- Customer interviews
- Churned customer exit interviews
- Sales team debriefs

**Look for patterns**:
- What do 50%+ of customers mention?
- What alternatives appear in multiple contexts?
- What's the PRIMARY alternative (most common)?

---

### Step 3: Map Alternatives by Type (20 minutes)

Categorize alternatives into these buckets:

| Alternative Type | Definition | Your Alternatives |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Direct Competitors** | Same category, similar approach | |
| **Indirect Competitors** | Different category, same job | |
| **Status Quo** | Do nothing, live with pain | |
| **DIY Solutions** | Build it themselves | |
| **Manual Processes** | Spreadsheets, manual work | |
| **Adjacent Tools** | Repurpose other software | |

**Example (for marketing automation)**:
- Direct: HubSpot, Marketo, Pardot
- Indirect: CRM with email features, analytics tools
- Status Quo: Send batch emails manually, no automation
- DIY: Custom scripts, Zapier workflows
- Manual: Spreadsheet tracking, manual follow-ups
- Adjacent: Using sales tools for marketing

---

### Step 4: Prioritize by Frequency (15 minutes)

Not all alternatives are equal. Rank by how often customers choose them:

| Rank | Alternative | % of Deals | When They Choose It |
|------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | | % | |
| 2 | | % | |
| 3 | | % | |
| 4 | | % | |
| 5 | | % | |

**Data sources**:
- Win/loss analysis (what beats you?)
- "No decision" losses (what alternative did they stick with?)
- Sales pipeline data (what do prospects mention?)

**2024 Benchmark**: Gartner reports 40% of B2B deals end in "no decision" - status quo is almost always your #1 competitor.

---

### Step 5: Alternative Capability Analysis (30 minutes)

For your TOP 5 alternatives, map what they CAN and CANNOT do:

**Template for each alternative**:

### Alternative: [Name]

**Type**: Direct Competitor / Indirect / Status Quo / DIY / Manual

**What it does well**:
-
-
-

**What it does poorly or cannot do**:
-
-
-

**Why customers choose it**:
-
-

**Why customers leave it for us**:
-
-

**Our key advantages vs this alternative**:
-
-
-

---

**Example: Spreadsheets (for CRM software)**

**Type**: Manual/DIY solution

**What it does well**:
- Free (already have Excel/Sheets)
- Infinitely flexible
- No learning curve
- Complete control

**What it does poorly or cannot do**:
- No automation
- Breaks at scale (500+ contacts)
- No collaboration features
- Manual data entry required
- High error rates

**Why customers choose it**:
- Zero cost
- "Good enough" for small teams
- Familiar tool
- No procurement process

**Why customers leave it for us**:
- Team grows beyond 5-10 people
- Too many errors/lost deals
- Manual work becomes overwhelming
- Need reporting/analytics

**Our key advantages**:
- Automated data capture (50+ integrations)
- Built for teams (permissions, workflows)
- Zero manual data entry
- Real-time analytics and forecasting

---

### Step 6: Create Visual Competitive Map (20 minutes)

Plot alternatives on a 2x2 matrix to visualize landscape:

**Choose your axes** based on what matters to YOUR customers:

**Common axis pairs**:
- Ease of Use vs Power/Sophistication
- Price vs Features
- Generalist vs Specialist
- Do-It-Yourself vs Done-For-You
- Speed to Value vs Customization
- Technical vs Non-Technical

**Example Map** (Marketing Automation):

```
High Sophistication
        ^
        |
        |  Marketo    HubSpot
        |        YourProduct
        |
        |     Mailchimp
        |
        |  Manual Email   Spreadsheets
        |
        +------------------------->
    Low Price              High Price
```

**Your Map**:

```
[Y-axis label]
        ^
        |
        |
        |
        |
        |
        |
        |
        +------------------------->
                              [X-axis label]
```

**Key insights from your map**:
- Where are you positioned?
- Where is white space (underserved areas)?
- Where is overcrowding?
- What does this suggest about your positioning?

## Step 7: Competitive Differentiation Analysis (30 minutes)

For each major alternative, define how you're meaningfully different:

| Alternative | What They Emphasize | What We Emphasize | Key Differentiator |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [Alternative 1] | | | |
| [Alternative 2] | | | |
| [Alternative 3] | | | |
| [Alternative 4] | | | |
| Status Quo | | | |

**Example (project management tool vs status quo)**:

| Alternative | What They Emphasize | What We Emphasize | Key Differentiator |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Email/meetings | Communication | Execution & accountability | Built-in workflows with automated assignments |
| Spreadsheets | Flexibility | Collaboration at scale | Real-time updates, 50+ person teams |
| Asana | Task management | Strategic alignment | OKRs built into project execution |
| Status quo | Zero cost, no change | Time saved, velocity | Automated status reports save 10 hrs/week |

---

## Step 8: Win/Loss Pattern Analysis (20 minutes)

Identify why you win vs each alternative type:

### When we WIN vs [Alternative Type]

**Primary reason**:

**Supporting factors**:
-
-
-

**Champion quote** (from actual customer):

---

### When we LOSE to [Alternative Type]

**Primary reason**:

**Contributing factors**:
-
-
-

**What we learned**:

---

**Example**:

### When we WIN vs DIY/Spreadsheets

**Primary reason**: Customer hits scale ceiling (team > 10 people, spreadsheet breaks)

**Supporting factors**:
- High error rates causing lost deals
- Manual work taking 10+ hours per week
- Manager can't see team performance
- Onboarding new reps is painful

**Champion quote**: "We were spending more time updating the spreadsheet than selling. It was insane."

### When we LOSE to DIY/Spreadsheets

**Primary reason**: Team is too small (< 5 people), cost not justified

**Contributing factors**:
- Simple sales process, not much to track
- Budget constraints
- "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality
- Implementation effort seems high

**What we learned**: Don't pursue companies with < 5 sales reps. Our ICP starts at 10+ reps.

## Step 9: Positioning Implications (15 minutes)

Based on your competitive alternatives analysis, answer:

**1. Who are our REAL top 3 competitors?** (Not who you think, who customers compare you to)

1.
2.
3.

**2. What's the most common alternative we need to displace?**



**3. What capabilities must we emphasize to beat that alternative?**

-
-
-

**4. What value story resonates most when competing against this?**



**5. Who is our positioning making it EASY to beat?**



**6. Who is our positioning making it HARD to beat?**



**7. Should we change our market category to improve competitive landscape?**

☐ Yes - Consider:
☐ No - Current category is optimal

---

## Step 10: Refine Your Positioning (30 minutes)

Use competitive alternatives insights to sharpen positioning:

## 2024 Case Study: Databook

**Original positioning**: "Sales intelligence platform"
**Competitive alternatives identified**: Assumed ZoomInfo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, similar tools

**What testing revealed**: Real alternatives were:
1. **Spreadsheets** (60% of prospects)
2. **Manual relationship tracking** (30%)
3. Sales intelligence tools (10%)

**Positioning change**: "Strategic Relationship Management (SRM)" - new category

**Why this worked**:
- Competed against manual/spreadsheet status quo (easier to win)
- Created new category where they're the leader
- Emphasized relationship strategy, not just data

**Results**:
- 67% website conversion increase
- 10x inbound lead growth
- Won deals in 2 weeks vs 3 months

**Key lesson**: Your assumed competitors might not be your real competitors. Test with actual customers.

---

## Testing Your Alternatives Map

Before finalizing, validate with:

### Internal Validation
- **Sales team review**: "Do these match what you hear in deals?"
- **Customer success**: "What do churned customers move to?"
- **Win/loss data**: Does this align with actual outcomes?

### External Validation
- **Customer interviews**: "What else did you consider?"
- **Prospect surveys**: "What are you using today?"
- **Wynter testing**: Test messaging against each alternative type

### Red Flags
❌ No one mentions status quo/DIY (you're not asking right questions)
❌ Only listing direct competitors (missing 60-80% of real competition)
❌ Can't articulate why you beat each alternative (positioning gap)
❌ Losing to "no decision" often (status quo is beating you, need new positioning)

### Green Lights
✅ Clear pattern in what customers used before
✅ Different alternatives for different customer segments
✅ Specific reasons why customers switch from each alternative
✅ Win rate varies by alternative type (can predict)

---

## Quarterly Review Process

Competitive landscape changes. Review quarterly:

**Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 Review Checklist**:

☐ Reviewed last 20 win/loss interviews
☐ Analyzed "no decision" losses (what alternative did they choose?)
☐ Checked if new competitors have emerged
☐ Validated top 3 alternatives are still accurate
☐ Updated capability comparison for each alternative
☐ Assessed if our differentiation is still relevant
☐ Reviewed if market category is still optimal
☐ Updated positioning based on findings

**Changes to watch for**:
- New funded competitor enters market
- Incumbent adds feature that closes your gap
- Market shifts to new category
- Regulatory change affects alternatives
- New DIY solution becomes popular (e.g., AI tools)

---

## Advanced: Alternative-Specific Messaging

For each major alternative, craft specific messaging:

### Against: [Alternative Name]

**Opening hook**:
"If you're currently using [alternative], you've probably experienced [pain point]..."

**Capability gap we solve**:
"Unlike [alternative], we [unique capability]..."

**Value proposition**:
"That means you can [specific outcome] without [alternative's limitation]."

**Proof point**:
"Companies like [customer name] switched from [alternative] and [specific result]."

**CTA**:
"See how [YourProduct] compares to [alternative] →"

---

**Example: Against Spreadsheets (CRM)**

**Opening**: "If you're tracking deals in spreadsheets, you know the pain of manual updates and formulas breaking."

**Capability gap**: "Unlike spreadsheets, our CRM automatically captures every customer interaction through 50+ integrations."

**Value proposition**: "That means zero manual data entry, and your forecasts are always accurate without spending hours updating cells."

**Proof point**: "Acme Corp switched from spreadsheets to [Product] and cut forecast prep time from 10 hours to 30 minutes per week."

**CTA**: "See how [Product] eliminates spreadsheet chaos →"
