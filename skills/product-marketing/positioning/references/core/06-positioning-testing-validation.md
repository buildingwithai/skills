# Positioning Testing & Validation

Don't launch untested positioning. Companies that test see 40-70% conversion improvements and 10x lead growth. Testing is no longer optional — it's the difference between guessing and knowing.

## Overview

**The positioning testing paradox**: You can't know if positioning works until you test it, but most companies launch without testing.

**Why companies skip testing**:
- "We don't have budget" (costs $900)
- "We don't have time" (takes 2-3 days)
- "We know our customers" (but do you know how prospects perceive you?)
- "Internal feedback is enough" (internal teams are too close to the product)

**Reality**: Testing positioning costs $900 and 3 days. Launching bad positioning costs months of confused prospects, low conversion, and wasted marketing spend.

**2024 data shows**: Companies that test positioning before launch see:
- **67-73% conversion rate improvements** (Databook, Appcues)
- **10x inbound lead growth** (Databook)
- **40%+ demo booking increases** (Cognism)

**Testing is not optional** — it's the highest ROI activity in positioning.

## Why Test Positioning?

### What Testing Reveals

**Positioning testing answers**:

1. **Clarity**: Do prospects understand what you do? (in 10 seconds)
2. **Relevance**: Do they see it as for them?
3. **Value**: Do they want what you're offering?
4. **Differentiation**: Do they understand how you're different?
5. **Category**: Do they know where you fit in their mental map?

**Internal teams can't answer these** — they're too close to the product.

**Prospects reveal**:
- What's confusing
- What questions they still have
- How they describe you (becomes your messaging)
- What alternatives come to mind
- Whether differentiation resonates

---

### The Cost of Not Testing

**What happens when you launch untested positioning**:

**Scenario 1: Confusing positioning**
- Prospects don't understand what you do
- Website bounce rates spike
- Demo requests drop
- Sales cycles lengthen
- "What exactly do you do?" becomes most common question

**Scenario 2: Irrelevant positioning**
- Wrong audience attracted
- Poor-fit leads
- Low conversion rates
- High churn (customers didn't understand value)

**Scenario 3: Weak differentiation**
- Prospects see you as "another [category]"
- Price becomes main differentiation
- Lose to competitors on features
- No compelling reason to switch

**Cost to fix**: 3-6 months of confused market, lost opportunities, wasted ad spend

**Cost to prevent**: $900 and 3 days of testing

### The 5 Testing Layers

**Wynter tests positioning across 5 hierarchical layers** (based on thousands of B2B message tests):

#### Layer 1: Clarity (I get it)

**Question**: "Can prospects understand what you do in 10 seconds?"

**Test questions**:
- "In your own words, what does this company do?"
- "What's still unclear or confusing?"
- "What questions do you have after reading this?"

**Measurement**: 1-5 scale, "How clear is this message?"
**Target score**: **4.0+** out of 5
**Threshold**: <3.5 = fail (too confusing)

**Why it matters**: If they don't understand what you do, nothing else matters

**Example feedback** (actual Wynter tests):
- ✅ **Good clarity**: "They help sales teams manage strategic accounts proactively"
- ❌ **Poor clarity**: "I'm not sure if this is CRM software or consulting or what"

---

#### Layer 2: Relevance (It's for me)

**Question**: "Does it address their specific challenges?"

**Test questions**:
- "Is this relevant to challenges you're facing?"
- "Who do you think this is for?"
- "What makes this relevant (or not relevant) to you?"

**Measurement**: 1-5 scale, "How relevant is this to your current needs?"
**Target score**: **3.5+** out of 5
**Threshold**: <3.0 = fail (not relevant to this audience)

**Why it matters**: Clarity without relevance = "I get it but it's not for me"

**Example feedback**:
- ✅ **Good relevance**: "This addresses exactly what we struggle with — stakeholders constantly asking about roadmap"
- ❌ **Poor relevance**: "This might be useful for enterprise but not companies our size"

---

#### Layer 3: Value (I want it)

**Question**: "Does messaging increase motivation to act?"

**Test questions**:
- "What value would this provide to you or your organization?"
- "How excited are you about what's being offered?"
- "Would you want to learn more? Why or why not?"

**Measurement**: 1-5 scale, "How valuable would this be?"
**Target score**: **3.5+** out of 5
**Threshold**: <3.0 = fail (not compelling)

**Why it matters**: Relevant but not valuable = "Nice to have, not must have"

**Example feedback**:
- ✅ **Good value**: "This would save us 10+ hours per week and reduce miscommunication"
- ❌ **Poor value**: "Seems useful but we can probably keep using spreadsheets"

---

#### Layer 4: Differentiation (I get how this is different)

**Question**: "Do they understand what makes you unique?"

**Test questions**:
- "How is this different from other solutions?"
- "What makes this unique or special?"
- "What alternatives come to mind?"

**Measurement**: 1-5 scale, "How different is this from other options?"
**Target score**: **3.0+** out of 5
**Threshold**: <2.5 = fail (commodity positioning)

**Why it matters**: Valuable but not differentiated = "I'll buy the cheaper/known option"

**Example feedback**:
- ✅ **Good differentiation**: "Only tool I've seen that's specifically for strategic account relationships vs just CRM data"
- ❌ **Poor differentiation**: "Seems like every other project management tool I've looked at"

---

#### Layer 5: Brand (The personality resonates)

**Question**: "Does your brand voice and personality come through?"

**Test questions**:
- "How would you describe this company's personality?"
- "Does this feel authentic?"
- "Would you trust this company? Why or why not?"

**No numerical target** — qualitative assessment

**Why it matters**: Affects trust, premium pricing, loyalty

**Example feedback**:
- ✅ **Good brand**: "Professional but approachable, feels like they understand B2B challenges"
- ❌ **Poor brand**: "Generic tech company speak, doesn't stand out"

---

**Critical insight**: These layers are **hierarchical**

Prospects won't care about differentiation (layer 4) until they understand what you do (layer 1). They won't evaluate value (layer 3) until they know it's relevant to them (layer 2).

**Test and optimize in this order**: Clarity → Relevance → Value → Differentiation → Brand

### Real Wynter Case Studies (2024)

#### Case Study 1: Databook → SRM Repositioning

**Challenge**:
- Positioning in saturated "sales intelligence" market
- Baseline tests showed nobody understood what they offered
- Weak differentiation vs ZoomInfo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator

**Testing process**:
- **Phase 1**: Baseline test (confirmed fears — clarity scores <3.0)
- **Phase 2**: Improved messaging, tested again (better but still weak)
- **Phase 3**: Repositioned as "Strategic Relationship Management" (SRM) - new category
- **Phase 4**: Tested new positioning (scores jumped to 4.2+ clarity, 3.8+ differentiation)

**Results**:
- **67% website conversion increase**
- **10x inbound lead growth**
- Within **2 weeks of relaunch**
- Prospects could clearly explain value proposition (validated via Wynter)

**Key takeaway**: Testing revealed "sales intelligence" positioning didn't work. Category creation (SRM) differentiated them from all alternatives.

#### Case Study 2: Cognism

**Challenge**:
- High-traffic website pages but low conversion
- Unclear messaging on demo and home pages

**Testing process**:
- Used Wynter to validate and adjust messaging
- Tested multiple variations with target audience
- Iterated based on feedback

**Results**:

- ❌ **Frequent testing on tight budget** (expensive for weekly tests)

**Alternatives for these scenarios**: See "Internal Testing Methods" below

---

## Internal & No-Code Testing Methods

### When to Use Internal Methods

**Use internal testing if**:
- Limited budget (<$1,000)
- Very niche audience (hard to find in panels)
- Need faster iteration (daily testing)
- Want qualitative depth (1-on-1 conversations)

**Combine with Wynter** for best results:
- **Internal testing**: Quick iterations, deep insights
- **Wynter**: Validation with unbiased strangers at scale

---

### Method 1: Customer Interviews (Most Reliable)

**The approach**: Show positioning to 10-30 recent customers, get their reaction

**Setup** (1 day):
1. Create positioning artifact (statement, homepage mockup, or deck slide)
2. Recruit 10-15 customers (mix of new and long-time)
3. Schedule 15-20 min interviews

**Interview script**:

```
"Hi [Name], I'm testing some new positioning and would love your honest feedback.
I'm going to show you a description of [Company] and ask a few questions. Ready?"

[Show positioning statement/homepage]

Questions:
1. "In your own words, what does this company do?"
   → Tests clarity

2. "Who do you think this is for?"
   → Tests ICP accuracy

3. "How is this different from other options you've seen?"
   → Tests differentiation

4. "What value do you think this provides?"
   → Tests value proposition

5. "What's confusing or unclear?"
   → Reveals gaps

6. "If a colleague asked about us, how would you describe this?"
   → Reveals their mental model (use their language!)

7. "On a scale of 1-5, how clear is this?"
   → Quantitative metric
```

**Analysis**:
- **8+/10 understand what you do** = good clarity
- **Common themes** in their descriptions = use that language
- **Questions they ask** = positioning gaps to address
- **Alternatives they mention** = your competitive set (see core file 02)

**Time**: 3-5 hours total (1 day prep, 1 day interviews, 1 day analysis)
**Cost**: $0
**Sample size**: 10-15

**Limitation**: Customers already know you — may not reflect how prospects perceive positioning

---

### Method 2: Prospect Interviews (Higher Quality)

**The approach**: Show positioning to people who DON'T know you yet

**How to recruit prospects**:
- LinkedIn outreach: "Doing research, would you give feedback on positioning for $50 gift card?"
- Your email list (subscribers who haven't bought)
- Communities (Slack groups, forums) - "Need feedback, happy to compensate"
- Referrals from customers ("Can you intro someone in your network?")

**Incentive**: $25-50 Amazon gift card per 15-min interview

**Same interview script as Method 1**, but these people are seeing you fresh

**Why this is better than customer interviews**:
- **Unbiased** (they don't already understand you)
- **Reflects real prospect experience** (first impression)
- **Reveals actual confusion** (customers know you too well to be confused)

**Time**: 1 week (2 days recruiting, 1 day interviews, 1 day analysis)
**Cost**: $250-500 (10 interviews × $25-50)
**Sample size**: 10-20

**Best practice**: Mix 5 customers + 10 prospects for comprehensive feedback

---

### Method 3: Landing Page Tests

**The approach**: Create simple landing page with positioning, drive cold traffic, measure engagement

**Setup**:
1. **Build simple page** (Carrd, Webflow, Unbounce)
   - Hero with positioning statement
   - Brief value prop
   - Email signup CTA
   - No other distractions

2. **Drive traffic** (100-500 visitors)
   - **Paid ads**: Google, LinkedIn ($200-500 budget)
   - **Reddit/forums**: Post in relevant communities
   - **Cold outreach**: Email to prospects with link
   - **LinkedIn**: Share in target groups

3. **Measure**:
   - **Time on page** (avg 30-60+ seconds = good engagement)
   - **Scroll depth** (do they read to bottom?)
   - **Email signups** (conversion rate >5% = strong interest)
   - **Bounce rate** (<60% = good)

**Tools**: Google Analytics, Hotjar (heatmaps), Clarity (session recordings)

**Success metrics**:
- **Email signup rate**: 5-10% (strong positioning)
- **Avg time on page**: 45+ seconds (they're reading)
- **Scroll depth**: 70%+ reach bottom (engaged)
- **Bounce rate**: <60% (not immediately confused)

**Time**: 1-2 weeks
**Cost**: $200-500 (ads)
**Sample size**: 100-500 visitors

**Limitation**: Only measures engagement, not comprehension (can't ask follow-up questions)

---

### Method 4: "5-Second Test"

**The approach**: Show positioning for 5 seconds, then ask what they remember

**Why 5 seconds**: Average homepage view time — tests instant comprehension

**Setup**:
1. Use tools: UsabilityHub, Lyssna (formerly UsabilityHub), or Maze
2. Upload positioning screenshot (homepage hero, positioning statement)
3. Recruit testers (10-30 people)
4. Show for 5 seconds
5. Ask: "What do you remember? What did the company do?"

**Success criteria**:
- **8+/10 can recall** what you do = good clarity
- **They use your language** = messaging works
- **They can't recall** = too complex, confusing, or generic

**Time**: 1-2 days
**Cost**: $50-100 (UsabilityHub) or free with own recruitment
**Sample size**: 20-30

**Best for**: Testing clarity only (not value or differentiation)

---

### Method 5: A/B Testing Live Site

**The approach**: Show different positioning to different visitors, measure conversion

**When to use**: When you have existing traffic (500+ visitors/month)

**Setup**:
1. Create 2 versions of homepage/positioning
2. Split traffic 50/50 (use Google Optimize, VWO, or Optimizely)
3. Run for 2-4 weeks (need statistical significance)
4. Measure conversion (email signup, demo request, trial signup)

**Sample size required**:
- **Minimum**: 100 conversions per variant (need 1,000+ visitors if 10% conversion rate)
- **Ideal**: 300+ conversions per variant for confidence

**Success criteria**:
- **20%+ improvement** = clear winner
- **5-10% improvement** = marginal, run longer
- **No difference** = neither positioning is compelling (both need work)

**Time**: 2-4 weeks
**Cost**: Tool cost ($50-500/month depending on platform)
**Sample size**: 1,000+ visitors

**Limitation**: Can only test incremental changes (not radically different positioning)

## Positioning Validation Frameworks

### Steve Blank Customer Development

**Framework**: Continuous customer discovery and validation

**Applied to positioning**:

**Phase 1: Discovery**
- Interview 10-30 customers/prospects
- Understand their problem, alternatives, language
- **Output**: Draft positioning based on customer reality

**Phase 2: Validation**
- Test positioning with new prospects (not customers)
- Show homepage, positioning statement, value prop
- Ask: "Does this match your problem? Is it clear? Relevant? Differentiated?"
- **Output**: Validated or iterate based on feedback

**Phase 3: Efficiency**
- Launch positioning to market
- Measure conversion, engagement, sales cycles
- **Output**: Scaled positioning

**Iteration**: Repeat when positioning feels off or metrics decline

**Time**: 4-6 weeks for full cycle
**Cost**: Mostly time (interviews)

**Best practice**: Never stop customer development — always be validating

---

### Continuous Validation (2024 Best Practice)

**Positioning isn't static** — markets evolve, competitors change, products expand

**Ongoing validation cadence**:

**Monthly**:
- Monitor conversion metrics (web, demo, trial)
- Sales call analysis (are prospects confused?)
- Win/loss feedback (what resonates, what doesn't)

**Quarterly**:
- **Customer interviews** (5-10 recent customers)
- **Positioning health check** (see scorecard below)
- **Competitive landscape review** (new entrants, positioning shifts)

**Annually**:
- **Full repositioning evaluation** (do we need to change?)
- **External message testing** (Wynter or similar)
- **ICP review** (has our best-fit customer changed?)

**Signals you need to revalidate**:
- Conversion rates declining
- Sales saying "prospects are confused"
- New competitor with strong positioning
- Product significantly evolved
- Market category shifted

**Don't wait for crisis** — proactive validation prevents positioning drift

---

## Positioning Health Scorecard

### Monthly Positioning Check

**Ask these questions monthly**:

| Question | Yes/No | Target |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Clarity**: Can sales explain what we do in 30 seconds? | | 9/10 reps |
| **Prospect clarity**: Do prospects understand in first call? | | 8/10 calls |
| **Relevance**: Are we attracting right ICP? | | 70%+ leads |
| **Differentiation**: Can prospects articulate how we're different? | | 6/10 calls |
| **Consistency**: Are all teams using same positioning? | | 8/10 teams |
| **Metrics**: Conversion rates stable or improving? | | Stable/up |

**Score**:
- **5-6 Yes**: Positioning is healthy
- **3-4 Yes**: Warning signs, investigate
- **0-2 Yes**: Positioning needs work

---

### Quantitative Metrics to Track

**Website**:
- **Bounce rate**: <60% (visitors aren't immediately confused)
- **Time on page**: 45+ seconds avg (they're reading)
- **Scroll depth**: 60%+ scroll to fold (engaged)

**Conversion**:
- **Visitor → Email**: 3-5% (good positioning attracts right people)
- **Email → Demo**: 10-20% (messaging resonates)
- **Demo → Trial/Customer**: 20-30% (positioning sets right expectations)

**Sales**:
- **First call clarity**: "They understood what we do" (8/10 calls)
- **Objections**: Decreasing "what do you do?" questions
- **Sales cycle**: Stable or decreasing (good positioning accelerates)

**Leading indicators** (predict positioning issues):
- Rising bounce rates
- Declining demo requests
- More "what do you do?" objections
- Longer sales cycles

**Fix positioning before lagging indicators** (churn, revenue) are affected

---

## Common Positioning Testing Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Only Testing Internally

**What companies do**: Show positioning to team, exec, board — get thumbs up

**Why it fails**: Internal stakeholders already know the product deeply

**Example**:
- **Internal reaction**: "This is great! Very clear!"
- **Prospect reaction**: "I don't understand what this actually does"

**Fix**: Always test with external prospects who don't know you

---

### Mistake 2: Testing Messaging, Not Positioning

**Positioning** = Strategic foundation (who for, what category, why different)
**Messaging** = Tactical words (how you talk about positioning)

**What companies do**: A/B test headlines without testing underlying positioning

**Why it fails**: Polishing words on weak positioning doesn't fix the problem

**Example**:
- **Test A headline**: "The best project management tool"
- **Test B headline**: "Project management made simple"
- **Result**: Neither works because positioning is generic (another PM tool)

**Better**: Test different positioning angles
- **Angle 1**: "Roadmap communication for product teams" (specific use case)
- **Angle 2**: "Between Trello and Jira" (positioning gap)

**Fix**: Test positioning strategy first, then refine messaging

---

### Mistake 3: Small Sample Size

**What companies do**: Test with 3-5 people, declare it "validated"

**Why it fails**: Not statistically significant, outliers skew results

**Minimum sample sizes**:
- **Qualitative feedback**: 10-15 people (patterns emerge)
- **Quantitative scores**: 30+ people (statistical relevance)
- **A/B testing**: 100+ conversions per variant (confidence)

**Fix**: Test with enough people to see patterns, not just opinions

---

### Mistake 4: Only Testing One Variation

**What companies do**: Test current positioning, get feedback, launch

**Why it fails**: No comparison point — you don't know if alternative is better

**Better approach**:
- **Variation A**: Current positioning angle
- **Variation B**: Alternative angle
- **Variation C**: Radical different approach

**Test all three**, see which scores highest

**Example**:
- **A**: "Sales intelligence platform" (current)
- **B**: "Strategic relationship management" (new category)
- **C**: "Account-based sales platform" (different category)

**Result**: Variation B scored highest → became new positioning (Databook example)

---

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Negative Feedback

**What companies do**: Cherry-pick positive feedback, dismiss negative as "they don't get it"

**Why it fails**: Negative feedback reveals positioning gaps

**Example feedback**:
- **Negative**: "I don't understand the difference between this and [competitor]"
- **Wrong reaction**: "They're not our target audience"
- **Right reaction**: "Our differentiation isn't clear — fix it"

**Fix**: Negative feedback is MORE valuable than positive (shows where positioning breaks)

- [ ] Note patterns in feedback

**After test**:
- [ ] Review quantitative scores (clarity, relevance, value, differentiation)
- [ ] Read all qualitative feedback
- [ ] Identify themes (what's working, what's not)
- [ ] Decide: Launch, iterate, or pivot?

---

## Next Steps

**After positioning testing**:

1. **If scores are good** (clarity >4.0, relevance >3.5):
   → Launch positioning (update website, sales materials)
   → Move to messaging development (see `messaging` skill)

2. **If scores are weak** (clarity <3.5, relevance <3.0):
   → Iterate positioning based on feedback
   → Re-test new version
   → Don't launch until scores improve

3. **If differentiation is weak** (score <3.0):
   → Revisit competitive alternatives (core file 02)
   → Clarify differentiated value (core file 04)
   → Re-test with stronger differentiation

4. **If category is unclear**:
   → Consider category creation (advanced/category-design)
   → Test different category positioning
   → Validate category resonates

5. **Set up continuous validation**:
   → Monthly positioning health checks
   → Quarterly customer interviews
   → Annual external testing (Wynter)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Testing is NOT optional** — companies see 40-73% conversion improvements from testing
2. **Wynter for B2B** — $899, 12-48 hours, validated with target audience
3. **5 testing layers** — Clarity (4.0+), Relevance (3.5+), Value (3.5+), Differentiation (3.0+), Brand
4. **Internal methods work** — Customer/prospect interviews, landing pages, 5-second tests
5. **Test with strangers** — Internal teams and customers are too close to be objective
6. **Multiple variations** — Test alternatives, not just one option
7. **Continuous validation** — Monthly health checks, quarterly interviews, annual external tests
8. **Act on feedback** — Negative feedback reveals positioning gaps to fix

**Remember**: $900 and 3 days of testing beats 3 months of confused prospects and low conversion. Test your positioning before you launch it. The ROI is undeniable.
