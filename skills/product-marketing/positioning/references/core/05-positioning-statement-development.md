# Positioning Statement Development Process

Complete guide to the workshop process for creating, testing, and refining positioning statements.

## Overview

**What this guide covers**: The collaborative PROCESS of developing positioning statements, not the formats themselves.

**For formats and templates**: See assets/positioning-statement-templates.md

**Why positioning workshops matter**:
- Positioning created in isolation fails (no buy-in)
- Cross-functional input reveals blind spots
- Workshop process builds alignment
- Collaborative development = stronger execution

**2024 Update**: Companies that run structured positioning workshops see:
- **78% higher internal alignment** on positioning (Gong internal research)
- **2-3 weeks faster** GTM execution (teams know what to do)
- **40% fewer revisions** to messaging (clearer foundation)

**The outcome**: A positioning statement that the entire GTM team understands, believes in, and can execute against.

## Part 1: Pre-Workshop Preparation

### Step 1: Assemble the Right Team (1-2 days before)

**Who must attend**:
- ✅ **Product Marketing** (lead facilitator)
- ✅ **Product Management** (knows capabilities and roadmap)
- ✅ **Sales** (2-3 top-performing reps who win deals)
- ✅ **Customer Success** (talks to customers daily, knows what works)
- ✅ **Founder/CEO** (for tie-breaking, strategic context, buy-in)

**Who should attend** (if possible):
- Marketing leader (for GTM execution)
- Sales engineer (technical perspective)
- Data/Analytics (quantitative insights)

**Who should NOT attend**:
- ❌ Too many people (max 8-10, becomes unwieldy)
- ❌ People unfamiliar with customers (no context)
- ❌ People who can't commit to full workshop

---

### Step 2: Complete Pre-Work (3-5 days before)

Before the workshop, gather:

**Customer Research**:
- ☐ Win/loss interview transcripts (last 20 deals)
- ☐ Customer interview notes (10-15 best customers)
- ☐ Sales call recordings/transcripts (Gong, Chorus)
- ☐ Churn exit interviews

**Market Research**:
- ☐ Competitive landscape analysis
- ☐ Market category trends
- ☐ ICP analysis (top 20% customer patterns)
- ☐ Competitive alternatives map

**Internal Data**:
- ☐ Win rate by segment
- ☐ Sales cycle length by customer type
- ☐ Expansion rates by cohort
- ☐ Product usage by feature

**Pre-read for attendees** (send 2-3 days before):
- ☐ Current positioning (if exists)
- ☐ Summary of customer research findings
- ☐ ICP definition draft
- ☐ Competitive alternatives list
- ☐ Workshop agenda

---

### Step 3: Set Workshop Logistics

**Format**: In-person preferred, virtual possible

**Duration**:
- **Option A**: 1 full day (8 hours with breaks)
- **Option B**: 2 half-days (4 hours each, 2-3 days apart)
- **Option C**: 5 sessions over 2 weeks (2 hours each)

**Recommended**: Option B (2 half-days) - allows time to reflect between sessions

**Location**:
- Off-site if possible (fewer distractions)
- Room with whiteboards or large sticky note walls
- Good AV for virtual participants

**Materials needed**:
- Large sticky notes (3+ colors)
- Sharpies (thick, easy to read)
- Whiteboard or large paper
- Printed customer quotes
- Laptop + projector
- Snacks (seriously, workshops are draining)

---

### Step 4: Set Expectations (1 day before)

**Email to participants**:

Subject: Positioning Workshop - What to Expect

Hi team,

We're coming together [date/time] to define our positioning. Here's what to expect:

**Goal**: Create a clear positioning statement that makes us the obvious choice for our best-fit customers.

**Not**: Writing marketing copy or taglines. We're defining internal strategy that will guide all messaging.

**Your role**:
- Share your perspective (no one person has all answers)
- Challenge assumptions respectfully
- Be open to new insights (even if it contradicts current thinking)
- Commit to the outcome (we'll make decisions together)

**Pre-read**: [attach materials]

**What to bring**:
- Stories from recent customer wins/losses
- Questions or frustrations about current positioning
- Open mind

See you [day]!

## Part 3: Facilitating the Workshop

### Opening: Set the Stage (30 minutes)

**Welcome and context**:
"Thank you for being here. We're going to define our positioning - the foundation of all our GTM strategy. This is not about writing marketing copy. It's about clearly articulating who we're for, what makes us different, and why customers should choose us.

Everyone here was selected because you have critical perspective. Sales, you know what wins deals. Product, you know what we can actually deliver. CS, you know what makes customers successful. We need all of this.

Ground rules:
1. No idea is stupid in brainstorming
2. Challenge assumptions (including mine)
3. Stay customer-focused (not internal preferences)
4. We'll make decisions by consensus, but I'll tie-break if needed
5. Phones away, laptops closed except for note-taking

Let's start with a question: What's working in our current positioning? What's not?"

**Go around the room** (2 minutes each):
- What's one thing about our current positioning that's working?
- What's one thing that's confusing or broken?

**Capture on whiteboard**: Patterns will emerge

---

### Exercise 1: Competitive Alternatives (45 minutes)

**Objective**: Identify what customers would use if we didn't exist

**Instructions**:
"Let's map out what our best customers were doing before us. Not just direct competitors - everything. Status quo, DIY, manual processes, different categories.

Sales team: What do you hear in discovery calls?
CS team: What do churned customers move to?
Product: What do customers say they're replacing?"

**Activity**:
1. Individual brainstorm (5 min): Write alternatives on sticky notes (one per note)
2. Group share (15 min): Put all notes on wall, group similar ones
3. Prioritize (15 min): Vote on top 5 by frequency (what do customers mention most?)
4. Validate (10 min): Does this match win/loss data?

**Output**: Ranked list of top 5 competitive alternatives

**Common insight**: Status quo/"do nothing" is often #1 (40% of B2B deals)

**Facilitator tip**: If team only lists direct competitors, push back:
"What about the customer who told us they were using spreadsheets? What about the deals we lost to 'no decision'?"

---

### Exercise 2: Unique Capabilities (45 minutes)

**Objective**: Identify what only we can do

**Instructions**:
"Now let's list what we can do that those alternatives cannot. Be ruthless - it has to be truly unique, not just claimed.

Test: Could a competitor credibly claim this? If yes, not unique."

**Activity**:
1. Individual brainstorm (10 min): What makes us different? (sticky notes)
2. Group share (15 min): Put notes on wall
3. Challenge (15 min): For each, ask: "Is this really unique? Could [competitor] say this?"
   - Green sticky = truly unique
   - Yellow sticky = somewhat unique
   - Red sticky = not actually unique
4. Prioritize (5 min): Focus on green stickies

**Output**: 5-8 truly unique capabilities

**Common trap**: Teams list table stakes ("secure", "scalable", "easy to use")

**Facilitator tip**:
"Let's test this. I'm going to read these capabilities without our name. Could these describe [competitor]? If yes, we need to dig deeper."

**Real example**:
- ❌ "AI-powered insights" (too vague, everyone claims)
- ✅ "AI trained on 10M+ B2B sales conversations analyzes talk patterns that correlate with won deals" (specific, provable, unique)

---

### Break (15 minutes)

---

### Exercise 3: Map Capabilities to Value (60 minutes)

**Objective**: Translate "what we do" into "what customers get"

**Instructions**:
"Features don't sell. Value sells. For each unique capability, let's map to the value customers get.

Framework: Because we have [capability], customers get [benefit]."

**Activity**:
1. Take top 5 unique capabilities from Exercise 2
2. For each capability, break into groups of 2-3:
   - What does the USER get? (day-to-day benefit)
   - What does the CHAMPION get? (person who advocates for us)
   - What does the ECONOMIC BUYER get? (person who signs check)
3. Groups share (30 min total): Present capability → value mapping
4. Discussion (15 min): Which value propositions are most compelling?
5. Prioritize (10 min): Top 3 value propositions

**Output**: Capability-to-value map for top capabilities

**Facilitator guide**:
- Push for specificity: "What does 'save time' mean? 5 minutes or 5 hours?"
- Push for personas: "Who specifically gets this value?"
- Push for proof: "Do we have evidence customers experience this?"

**Example**:

| Capability | User Value | Champion Value | Economic Buyer Value |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| Auto-record all sales calls | Never take notes during calls (focus on customer) | Can coach with actual examples (not hearsay) | Improve forecast accuracy from 70% to 92% |

---

### Exercise 4: Best-Fit Customers (30 minutes)

**Objective**: Define who cares most about our differentiated value

**Instructions**:
"We can't position for everyone. Who are the customers for whom we're obviously the best choice?"

**Pre-work reference**: Share ICP analysis (if completed)

**Activity**:
1. Review top 20% customer patterns (10 min):
   - Industry, size, use case, behavior
2. Discussion (15 min):
   - "Looking at our value props, who cares most?"
   - "Who buys fastest and becomes best customers?"
   - "Where do we win most easily?"
3. Define ICP (5 min): Write clear description

**Output**: Best-fit customer description

**Example**:
"B2B SaaS sales leaders with 10-50 reps who struggle with forecast accuracy and can't scale coaching. Typically $10M-$100M ARR, high-growth phase."

**Facilitator tip**: If team wants to target everyone, ask:
"If we had to pick ONE segment to dominate in the next 12 months, who would it be? Start there."

---

### Lunch Break (60 minutes)

Use this time for:
- Facilitator: Synthesize morning insights
- Participants: Process what we've learned
- Informal discussion continues (often valuable)

---

### Exercise 5: Market Category (60 minutes)

**Objective**: Choose the context that makes our value obvious

**Instructions**:
"Category sets expectations. When we say 'CRM,' people expect certain features and pricing. When we say 'Revenue Intelligence,' different expectations.

The right category makes our strengths obvious. The wrong category invites unfavorable comparisons."

**Activity**:
1. Brainstorm categories (15 min):
   - What categories could we compete in?
   - What do customers call us?
   - What do we show up in (G2, Gartner)?
   - Are there subcategories or new categories?
2. Evaluate each category (30 min):

   For each category option:
   - Who are the leaders/incumbents?
   - What are expected capabilities?
   - Can we credibly claim to be "best" here?
   - Does this make our differentiation obvious?
   - What comparisons does this invite?

3. Vote (10 min): Which category positions us best?
4. Decide (5 min): Choose market category

**Three strategies**:
- **Head-to-head**: Compete directly ("We're a better CRM")
- **Big fish, small pond**: Dominate subcategory ("We're the CRM for real estate")
- **Create new**: Define new category ("We're not CRM, we're Revenue Intelligence")

**Output**: Chosen market category with rationale

**Facilitator tip**:
Test each category: "In [category], can we credibly claim to be the best for [ICP]?"

If no to any, wrong category.

---

### Exercise 6: Draft Positioning Statements (60 minutes)

**Objective**: Synthesize everything into clear positioning

**Instructions**:
"Now we bring it all together. We'll use April Dunford's format since it captures all elements clearly.

Template:
For [best-fit customer]
Who [need/situation]
[Product] is a [market category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [alternatives]
We [unique capabilities]"

**Activity**:
1. Break into 2-3 small groups (20 min):
   - Each group drafts a positioning statement
   - Use sticky notes from earlier exercises
   - Don't overthink, just draft

2. Gallery walk (15 min):
   - Each group presents their draft
   - No critique yet, just listen

3. Identify patterns (10 min):
   - What's similar across drafts?
   - What's different?
   - What resonates?

4. Synthesize (15 min):
   - Combine best elements from each draft
   - Facilitator writes on whiteboard

**Output**: Draft positioning statement(s)

---

### Break (15 minutes)

---

### Exercise 7: Review and Critique (45 minutes)

**Objective**: Pressure-test the draft positioning

**Instructions**:
"Let's stress-test this. I'm going to ask tough questions. The goal is to make this stronger, not tear it down."

**Activity**:
Read draft positioning statement, then:

**Clarity test** (10 min):
- "If I'm a prospect, do I understand what you do?"
- "Is anything confusing or jargon-heavy?"
- "Can I explain this to someone else?"

**Differentiation test** (10 min):
- "Could a competitor say this?"
- "What makes this unique?"
- "If we removed our name, would this stand out?"

**Relevance test** (10 min):
- "Does this match our ICP's pain?"
- "Would they care about this?"
- "Does this reflect how they think?"

**Proof test** (10 min):
- "Can we prove these claims?"
- "Do we have evidence?"
- "Would customers agree this is their experience?"

**Refinement** (5 min):
- Based on feedback, what needs to change?

**Output**: Critique and refinement notes

---

### Exercise 8: Finalize Positioning (45 minutes)

**Objective**: Land on final positioning statement

**Activity**:
1. Revise based on critique (20 min):
   - Facilitator revises on whiteboard
   - Group wordsmithing
   - Test each change against criteria

2. Final review (15 min):
   - Read final version
   - Each person: "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in this positioning?"
   - If anyone < 7, discuss concerns

3. Commit (10 min):
   - "This is our positioning. We all agree to rally behind this."
   - Everyone signs (literally or figuratively)
   - Discuss what happens if someone disagrees later

**Output**: Final positioning statement with team commitment

---

### Closing: Next Steps (30 minutes)

---

## Part 4: Common Workshop Challenges

### Challenge #1: "Positioning Baggage"

**Problem**: Team can't see product objectively due to history

**Symptoms**:
- "But we've always been [X]"
- "We built this to be [Y]"
- Defending old positioning even when it's not working

**Solution - Competitor Exercise**:
"Let's pretend we're positioning our biggest competitor's product. Looking at it objectively, how would you position them?"

Often reveals clearer positioning than trying to position your own product.

Then: "Now let's look at our product with that same objectivity."

---

### Challenge #2: Trying to Position for Everyone

**Problem**: Team resists narrowing ICP

**Symptoms**:
- "But we can serve [X] too!"
- "Why exclude [Y] segment?"
- Positioning becomes too broad to be meaningful

**Solution - Beachhead Exercise**:
"If we had to pick ONE segment to completely dominate in the next 12 months, which would it be? That's our beachhead. We can expand later, but we need to win somewhere first."

**Data to use**: Show win rates by segment, sales cycle by type, expansion rates by customer

---

### Challenge #3: Feature-Focused Instead of Value-Focused

**Problem**: Team lists capabilities instead of benefits

**Symptoms**:
- Positioning reads like feature list
- No clear "so what?" for customer
- Internal perspective dominates

**Solution - "So What?" Exercise**:
For every capability mentioned, ask "So what? Why should the customer care?"

Keep asking until you get to real value.

Example:
- "We have AI." → So what?
- "It analyzes conversations." → So what?
- "It surfaces risks." → So what?
- "You can save at-risk deals." → So what?
- "You hit your number." → THAT'S the value.

---

### Challenge #4: Disagreement on Market Category

**Problem**: Team split on which category to compete in

**Symptoms**:
- Sales wants existing category (easier to explain)
- Product wants new category (more innovative)
- Marketing wants something differentiated

**Solution - Win Rate Analysis**:
Look at actual data:
- Where do we have highest win rates?
- Where do deals close fastest?
- Where is our value most obvious?

Let data decide, not opinions.

**Tie-breaker**: CEO/Founder makes final call based on strategy.

---

### Challenge #5: Workshop Fatigue

**Problem**: Energy drops, people disengage

**Symptoms**:
- Checking phones
- Side conversations
- Generic contributions

**Prevention**:
- Keep sessions to 4 hours max
- Take breaks every 60-90 minutes
- Use interactive exercises (not just discussion)
- Bring snacks and coffee
- Mix up groups (don't let same people dominate)

**If it happens**:
- Call a 15-minute break
- Change activity format
- Get people moving (stand up exercise)

---

## Part 5: Post-Workshop Testing

### Week 1-2: Validate Positioning

**Don't skip this step.** Companies that test positioning see 40-73% better results.

#### Test 1: Customer Interviews (10-15 interviews)

**Who to interview**: Mix of current customers and recent prospects

**Interview script**:

"We've been refining our positioning and I'd love your perspective.

[Read positioning statement]

Questions:
1. Does this resonate with why you chose us?
2. Is anything confusing or unclear?
3. What stands out as most valuable to you?
4. How would you describe us to a colleague?
5. What would you change about this?"

**What to listen for**:
- ✅ "Yes, this is exactly why we bought"
- ✅ "This would have made our decision easier"
- ✅ "The [X] part really resonates"
- ❌ "I don't really understand what you do"
- ❌ "This doesn't match my experience"
- ❌ "Sounds like everyone else"

**Scoring**:
- 8-10/15 positive responses: Strong positioning, proceed
- 5-7/15: Moderate positioning, refine specific elements
- <5/15: Weak positioning, significant changes needed

---

#### Test 2: Wynter Message Testing ($899, 12-48 hours)

**What to test**: Convert positioning into message-based assets
- Homepage hero section mockup
- Sales deck opening slides
- Email outreach templates

**Target audience**: Your ICP (Wynter verifies panelists match)

**What Wynter measures**:
- **Clarity** (4.0+/5): Do they understand what you do?
- **Relevance** (3.5+/5): Is it relevant to their situation?
- **Value** (3.5+/5): Do they see the value?
- **Differentiation** (3.0+/5): Can they explain how you're different?

**Plus qualitative feedback**: What resonates? What's confusing?

**Scoring interpretation**:
- **All scores hit targets**: Strong positioning, launch
- **1-2 scores low**: Refine specific elements
- **Multiple scores low**: Significant positioning revision needed

---

#### Test 3: Sales Team Validation

**What to do**: Give sales team the positioning, have them use in 5-10 prospect calls

**Questions for sales**:
- "Does this help you compete?"
- "Do prospects understand it?"
- "What questions do they ask?"
- "Where does it break down?"
- "What proof points do you need?"

**Red flags**:
- ❌ "This doesn't match how prospects talk"
- ❌ "I can't explain this clearly"
- ❌ "Prospects don't care about [X]"

**Green lights**:
- ✅ "This shortens discovery conversations"
- ✅ "Prospects immediately get it"
- ✅ "Differentiation is clear"

---

### Week 3: Refine Based on Testing

**Review test results** with core team:

1. **What worked well?**
   - Which elements scored highest?
   - What resonated most?
   - What made positioning clear?

2. **What needs refinement?**
   - Which elements scored low?
   - What was confusing?
   - What didn't resonate?

3. **What changes to make?**
   - Specific edits to positioning statement
   - Additional proof points needed
   - Clarifications to add

**Make revisions**, then:
- **Option A**: Launch (if scores are strong)
- **Option B**: Retest (if significant changes)

---

## Part 6: Internal Rollout

---

## Part 7: Iteration and Maintenance

### Quarterly Positioning Review

Every quarter, review positioning health:

**Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 Checklist**:

☐ **Win rates by ICP**: Are we winning with target customers?
☐ **Sales feedback**: Does positioning help in deals?
☐ **Competitive shifts**: Has landscape changed?
☐ **Product changes**: Do capabilities still match positioning?
☐ **Customer feedback**: Does positioning match their experience?
☐ **Market category**: Is category still relevant?

**Triggers for repositioning**:
- ✅ Win rates declining with ICP (positioning not working)
- ✅ New competitive threat (landscape shifted)
- ✅ Major product evolution (capabilities changed)
- ✅ Market category matured/changed
- ✅ Testing shows low scores (<3.5/5)

**Minor refinements OK**, major repositioning every 18-24 months max.

---

## 2024 Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Positioning Workshop Success - Userlist

**Challenge**: Positioned as "email automation for SaaS" - generic, crowded

**Workshop Insights**:
- Competitive alternatives: NOT other email tools, but generic tools that don't understand SaaS metrics
- Unique capability: Native integration with SaaS data (Stripe, product analytics)
- Value: Segment by subscription tier + product usage (not just demographics)
- ICP: B2B SaaS with freemium/trial models (not all SaaS)

**New Positioning**: "Customer messaging for SaaS companies"
- Subcategory (not email automation)
- SaaS-specific (not generic)
- Focused ICP (not all companies)

**Result**: "Magic effect on customer understanding" - immediately resonated

**Key lesson**: Workshop revealed ICP's real alternative (generic tools) wasn't what team assumed (email tools)

---

### Case Study 2: Testing Catches Positioning Gap - B2B SaaS Company

**Workshop Output**: Positioned as "revenue acceleration platform"

**Wynter Test Results**:
- Clarity: 2.8/5 (target 4.0+) ❌
- Relevance: 3.2/5 (target 3.5+) ❌
- Value: 3.1/5 (target 3.5+) ❌

**Feedback**: "What does 'revenue acceleration' mean? Too vague."

**Refinement Workshop**: Revised to "sales coaching platform powered by conversation AI"

**Retest Results**:
- Clarity: 4.2/5 ✅
- Relevance: 3.8/5 ✅
- Value: 3.6/5 ✅

**Key lesson**: Internal team loved "revenue acceleration" but market didn't understand it. Testing saved months of confused prospects.
