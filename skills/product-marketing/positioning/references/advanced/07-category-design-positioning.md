# Category Design Positioning

Complete guide to creating and dominating new market categories using category design principles.

## Overview

**What is category design**: The practice of defining, developing, and dominating a new market category where you're the de facto leader.

**Why it matters**:
- Category kings capture 76% of market cap in their category (Play Bigger, 2024 data)
- First to define category typically maintains leadership for 5-10+ years
- Eliminates direct competition by creating new frame of reference
- Commands premium pricing (no comparables)

**2024 Update**: Category design is experiencing resurgence:
- **AI-driven categories**: Dozens of new AI subcategories emerged 2023-2024 ("Revenue AI", "Document Intelligence", "Conversational AI")
- **Christopher Lochhead**: Updated "Dirty Dozen" framework (Nov 2024) - pragmatic approach to category creation
- **Economic pressure**: Crowded markets driving more companies to category design as differentiation strategy

**When to use category design positioning**:
- ✅ Truly novel approach that doesn't fit existing categories
- ✅ Existing categories are saturated/commoditized
- ✅ Have resources to educate market (time, money, patience)
- ✅ Can credibly claim to be the best in new category

**When NOT to use**:
- ❌ Product fits well in existing category
- ❌ Limited resources for market education
- ❌ Need short sales cycles (category creation takes time)
- ❌ Creating category for novelty's sake (not real differentiation)

---

## Part 1: Category Design Fundamentals

### What Makes a Real Category?

**A category is NOT**:
- ❌ A feature (not a category: "AI-powered CRM")
- ❌ A technology (not a category: "blockchain-based payments")
- ❌ An industry vertical (not a category: "CRM for healthcare")
- ❌ Marketing spin (not a category: "next-generation platform")

**A category IS**:
- ✅ A new way to think about a problem
- ✅ A distinct set of capabilities that solve problems differently
- ✅ A frame that customers adopt to evaluate solutions
- ✅ A sustainable competitive position

---

### The Category Power Law

**Market cap distribution in established categories**:
- **Category King** (#1): 76% of total market cap
- **#2 player**: 14% of market cap
- **#3 player**: 6% of market cap
- **Everyone else**: 4% combined

**Source**: Play Bigger research across 300+ B2B software categories (2024 update)

**Implication**: Better to be #1 in smaller category than #3 in large category.

**Example**:
- Salesforce: Category king in Cloud CRM (76% of category value)
- HubSpot: Created "Inbound Marketing" category, became king (avoided competing directly with Salesforce)
- Gong: Created "Revenue Intelligence" category (not "call recording" or "sales analytics")

---

### Three Category Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Create Entirely New Category

**When**: No existing category fits your innovation

**Examples**:
- Salesforce: "Cloud CRM" (vs on-premise CRM)
- Slack: "Team Collaboration" (vs email or chat)
- Snowflake: "Data Cloud" (vs data warehouse)

**Investment required**: Highest (must educate market)
**Payoff**: Highest (category king advantage)
**Timeline**: 3-7 years to establish category

---

#### Strategy 2: Create Subcategory

**When**: Existing category is too broad, opportunity to own a niche

**Examples**:
- Superhuman: "Email for Executives" (subcategory of email clients)
- Airtable: "Collaborative Database" (subcategory between spreadsheets and databases)
- Userlist: "Customer Messaging for SaaS" (subcategory of email/messaging)

**Investment required**: Moderate (leverage existing category understanding)
**Payoff**: Moderate-High (can dominate niche)
**Timeline**: 1-3 years to own subcategory

---

#### Strategy 3: Redefine Existing Category

**When**: Category exists but incumbents are vulnerable

**Examples**:
- Databook: "Strategic Relationship Management" (redefining sales tools)
- Notion: "Connected Workspace" (redefining docs/wikis/project management)
- Linear: "Purpose-Built for Modern Software Teams" (redefining issue tracking)

**Investment required**: Moderate (category exists, reframing it)
**Payoff**: High (if reframe resonates)
**Timeline**: 2-4 years to shift perception

## Part 2: Christopher Lochhead's "Dirty Dozen" Framework (2024)

### Overview of Dirty Dozen

**Source**: Christopher Lochhead, "Category Pirates" newsletter (Nov 2024 update)

**Philosophy**: Category design isn't just positioning - it's strategic business design. Most important framework for category creation.

**The 12 elements of category design**:

---

### 1. Point of View (POV)

**What it is**: Your provocative thesis about the world

**Why it matters**: POV attracts people who think like you, repels people who don't

**Framework**:
- What's the OLD way of thinking? (that's broken)
- What's the NEW way of thinking? (that you champion)
- What's at stake? (why this matters NOW)

**Example - Gong's POV**:
- **Old way**: Sales leaders rely on CRM data and gut feel to forecast
- **New way**: Every customer conversation contains intelligence - analyze all of it
- **What's at stake**: Companies miss quota by 30% because they're managing sales in the dark

**Example - Salesforce's POV (1999)**:
- **Old way**: Enterprise software requires expensive servers and IT teams
- **New way**: Software should be delivered over the internet like utilities
- **What's at stake**: Companies waste millions on infrastructure vs innovation

**Your POV Template**:

**The old way**: ___________________________________________________________

**Why it's broken**: _______________________________________________________

**The new way**: ___________________________________________________________

**Why it's better**: ________________________________________________________

**What's at stake**: ________________________________________________________

---

### 2. Category Name

**What it is**: The label for your new way of thinking

**Why it matters**: Good name = easy to remember and repeat, bad name = confusing

**Characteristics of strong category names**:
- ✅ Descriptive (hints at what it does)
- ✅ Memorable (easy to recall)
- ✅ Ownable (you can claim it)
- ✅ Resonant (makes sense to target audience)

**Naming patterns**:
- **Problem + Solution**: "Revenue Intelligence", "Data Cloud"
- **Approach + Tool**: "Inbound Marketing", "Conversational AI"
- **Customer + Category**: "CRM for Startups" (subcategory)
- **Aspirational Outcome**: "Customer Success Platform"

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Revenue Intelligence" (Gong) - clear, descriptive
- ✅ "Strategic Relationship Management" (Databook) - borrows from CRM familiarity
- ❌ "Unified Omnichannel Engagement Platform" - too complex, buzzword-heavy

**Naming mistakes**:
- Too technical: "Polyglot Persistence Layer"
- Too vague: "Digital Transformation Platform"
- Too clever: Made-up words that don't mean anything
- Too long: More than 3 words

**Your category name**: _____________________________________________________

**Why this name**: _________________________________________________________

---

### 3. Category Blueprint (The Problem You Solve)

**What it is**: Clear articulation of the problem your category solves

**Why it matters**: If problem isn't painful enough, category won't matter

**Framework**:
- What's the PAIN? (status quo problem)
- Who feels it? (target audience)
- What's the IMPACT? (cost of inaction)
- What TRIGGERS action? (critical event)

**Example - Slack (Team Collaboration)**:

**Pain**: Teams drown in email, lose context across scattered tools, can't find what they need
**Who**: Knowledge workers at fast-moving companies
**Impact**: 30% of time wasted searching for information, slow decision-making, siloed teams
**Trigger**: Company grows beyond 20 people, email becomes unmanageable

**Your category blueprint**:

**Pain**: ___________________________________________________________________

**Who feels it**: ___________________________________________________________

**Impact**: ________________________________________________________________

**Trigger**: _______________________________________________________________

---

### 4. Category Definition

**What it is**: How you define the boundaries and characteristics of the category

**Format**: "[Category] is [definition]"

**Example - Revenue Intelligence** (Gong):
"Revenue Intelligence is the practice of capturing, analyzing, and acting on all customer interactions across the revenue organization to improve outcomes."

**Example - Strategic Relationship Management** (Databook):
"Strategic Relationship Management (SRM) is the systematic approach to mapping, tracking, and strengthening relationships across complex enterprise accounts."

**Your category definition**:

**[Category name] is**: _____________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________

---

### 5. Category Design (What Makes It Different)

**What it is**: The unique characteristics that separate your category from existing ones

**Framework**: "[New Category] vs [Old Category]"

| Dimension | Old Category | New Category |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Focus | | |
| Approach | | |
| Outcome | | |
| User | | |

**Example - Revenue Intelligence vs Sales Analytics**:

| Dimension | Sales Analytics | Revenue Intelligence |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Focus** | Historical reporting | Real-time intelligence |
| **Data Source** | CRM data only | All customer conversations |
| **Approach** | Dashboards for managers | AI-powered insights for everyone |
| **Outcome** | Understand what happened | Predict what will happen |
| **User** | Sales operations | Entire revenue org |

---

### 6. Lightning Strike (The Rallying Cry)

**What it is**: A provocative statement that polarizes the market

**Why it matters**: Creates conversation, gets attention, forces people to take a side

**Format**: Bold claim that challenges status quo

**Examples**:
- **Salesforce**: "No Software" (challenged on-premise norm)
- **HubSpot**: "Marketing has changed. Has your marketing?" (challenged outbound)
- **Drift**: "Your marketing site shouldn't be a museum" (challenged forms/downloads)

**Characteristics**:
- ✅ Provocative (makes people react)
- ✅ Clear (no ambiguity)
- ✅ Defensible (you can back it up)
- ✅ Memorable (easy to repeat)

**Your lightning strike**: ___________________________________________________

---

### 7. The Villain (What You're Fighting Against)

**What it is**: The enemy you're defeating (status quo, old way, incumbent mindset)

**Why it matters**: People unite against common enemies

**Your villain options**:
- Old category (e.g., "email is broken")
- Old approach (e.g., "manual processes")
- Status quo (e.g., "accepting mediocre results")
- Competitor mindset (e.g., "complexity for complexity's sake")

**Example - Gong's villain**: Sales decisions based on gut feel, incomplete CRM data, and guessing

**Example - Notion's villain**: Scattered tools (separate docs, wikis, tasks, databases) that don't talk to each other

**Your villain**: ___________________________________________________________

---

### 8. Proof of Category (Evidence It's Real)

**What it is**: Evidence that your category is a real, growing phenomenon

**Types of proof**:
- Customer adoption metrics
- Market research/analyst recognition
- Ecosystem development (partners, integrations)
- Funding/investment activity
- Media coverage

**Example - Revenue Intelligence category proof** (2024):
- Gartner created "Revenue Intelligence" category (2022)
- $1B+ in venture funding (2020-2024)
- 50+ vendors now claim "revenue intelligence"
- 30% of B2B companies evaluating category (SiriusDecisions)

**Your proof points**:
1. _____________________________________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________________________________

---

### 9. Category Economics

**What it is**: The economic model of your category

**Why it matters**: Categories with strong economics attract more players, which validates category

**Consider**:
- Pricing model (different from old category?)
- Unit economics (better margins?)
- Customer LTV (higher than alternatives?)
- Market size (TAM/SAM/SOM)

**Example - Cloud CRM economics vs On-Premise**:
- Subscription vs perpetual license
- Lower upfront cost ($100/user/mo vs $100K license)
- Higher LTV through renewals
- Expanded TAM (SMBs could now afford)

---

### 10. Ecosystem Play

**What it is**: Building a partner/integration ecosystem around your category

**Why it matters**: Ecosystem = network effects = harder for competitors to unseat you

**Ecosystem elements**:
- Technology partners (integrations)
- Channel/reseller partners
- Implementation partners (consultants)
- Developer ecosystem
- Community

**Example - Salesforce ecosystem**:
- AppExchange (3,000+ integrations)
- 150,000+ certified consultants
- Dreamforce (annual conference, 40,000+ attendees)
- Developer community

**Your ecosystem strategy**:

**Key integrations**: ______________________________________________________

**Partner types**: _________________________________________________________

**Community building**: _____________________________________________________

---

### 11. Missionary Sales

**What it is**: Educating market on the category (not just selling product)

**Why it matters**: In new category, prospects don't know they need you yet

**Missionary selling approach**:
- Lead with problem/category education
- Share POV and lightning strike
- Build urgency around status quo cost
- Position product as solution (not lead with it)

**Content for category education**:
- Category reports/research
- Educational content (not product-focused)
- Customer success stories (category adoption)
- Thought leadership (exec visibility)

**Example - Gong's missionary selling**:
- "Revenue Intelligence" research reports
- Educational content on conversation intelligence
- Customer stories of forecast improvement
- CEO Chris Orlob thought leadership on sales

---

### 12. Category King Positioning

**What it is**: Positioning yourself as the de facto leader/definer of the category

**Why it matters**: Category king captures 76% of value

**How to establish category king position**:
- ✅ First to name the category (primacy advantage)
- ✅ Most vocal about the category (share of voice)
- ✅ Most customers in category (social proof)
- ✅ Most complete solution (product breadth)
- ✅ Ecosystem leadership (integrations, partners)
- ✅ Analyst recognition (Gartner, Forrester placement)

**Category king signals**:
- Analyst reports reference you in category definition
- Competitors position against you
- Customers say "[Category] = [Your Brand]"
- Media uses your framing

---

## Part 3: The Category Design Process

### Phase 1: Category Research & Validation (2-4 weeks)

**Step 1: Validate you need a new category**

Test whether existing categories fit:

| Existing Category | Fit Assessment | Why/Why Not |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| | ☐ Good fit ☐ Poor fit | |
| | ☐ Good fit ☐ Poor fit | |
| | ☐ Good fit ☐ Poor fit | |

If multiple poor fits → new category may be needed

---

**Step 2: Customer problem validation**

Interview 20-30 customers/prospects:
- How do they describe the problem?
- How do they currently solve it?
- What category do they put you in?
- What's missing from existing categories?

**Look for patterns**: If customers struggle to categorize you, signal that new category needed

---

**Step 3: Competitive landscape**

Map existing categories:
- Who are category leaders?
- How saturated is category?
- How differentiated are you?
- Can you be #1 in existing category?

**Decision point**: If you can be #1 in existing category easily, stay there. If not, consider new category.

---

### Phase 2: Category Design (4-6 weeks)

**Step 1: Develop POV** (1 week)

- ☐ Evolve category as market matures

---

## Part 4: 2024 Category Design Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Gong - Revenue Intelligence (2016-2024)

**Challenge**: Launched as "sales call recording" - commoditized, low-value perception

**Category design approach**:

**POV**: Sales leaders manage deals in the dark (relying on CRM, gut feel). Every customer conversation has intelligence - analyze it.

**Category name**: "Revenue Intelligence" (descriptive, ownable)

**Category definition**: "The practice of capturing and analyzing all customer interactions to improve revenue outcomes"

**What makes it different**:
- Not call recording (captures emails, meetings too)
- Not sales analytics (real-time intelligence vs historical)
- Not just for sales (entire revenue org)

**Lightning strike**: "Your CRM is lying to you" (challenged status quo)

**Villain**: Incomplete CRM data, guesswork, gut feel forecasting

**Proof of category**:
- Gartner created "Revenue Intelligence & Operations" category (2022)
- 40+ vendors now claim revenue intelligence
- $2B+ in category funding
- Gong IPO trajectory as category leader

**Results**:
- Category king position (recognized leader)
- Premium pricing ($1,200-2,000/user/year vs $50-100 for call recording)
- 92% win rate in category (vs 40% in "sales tools")
- 2024 valuation: $7.25B

**Key lesson**: Created category to escape commoditization, became category king

---

### Case Study 2: Databook - Strategic Relationship Management (2024)

**Challenge**: Positioned in saturated "sales intelligence" market against ZoomInfo, LinkedIn

**Category design approach**:

**POV**: Account-based selling requires relationship strategy, not just contact data

**Category name**: "Strategic Relationship Management (SRM)" - borrows CRM familiarity

**Category definition**: "SRM is the systematic approach to mapping, tracking, and strengthening relationships across complex enterprise accounts"

**What makes it different**:

| Sales Intelligence | SRM |
|-------------------|-----|
| Contact data | Relationship maps |
| Breadth (millions of contacts) | Depth (account strategy) |
| Prospecting focus | Account expansion focus |
| Transactional | Strategic |

**Real competitive alternative**: Spreadsheets, not ZoomInfo (Wynter testing revealed)

**Lightning strike**: "Contact data doesn't win enterprise deals. Relationships do."

**Results** (within 6 months):
- 67% website conversion increase
- 10x inbound lead growth
- Escaped commodity sales intelligence pricing
- Created defensible position

**Key lesson**: Category design can work quickly if POV resonates strongly

---

### Case Study 3: Notion - Connected Workspace (2018-2024)

**Challenge**: Positioned against incumbent categories (docs, wikis, project management) - losing

**Category design approach**:

**POV**: Work is scattered across too many disconnected tools. Everything should connect.

**Category name**: "Connected Workspace" (later "All-in-One Workspace")

**What makes it different**:

| Notion (Connected Workspace) | Old Way (Separate Tools) |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Everything in one place | Docs here, tasks there, wiki elsewhere |
| Database + Docs + Tasks | Separate tools, no connection |
| Infinitely flexible | Rigid, pre-defined structures |
| Collaborative by default | Collaboration is add-on |

**Villain**: Tool sprawl, context switching, information silos

**Lightning strike**: "One tool. Your whole team. All together."

**Ecosystem play**:
- Template marketplace (10,000+ templates)
- Integration ecosystem
- Creator community
- Notion Ambassadors program

**Results**:
- 30M+ users (2024)
- $10B valuation
- Category leadership position
- Premium pricing vs docs/wiki tools

**Key lesson**: Redefined existing categories by connecting them

---

## Part 5: Category Design Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Fake Category (Not Real Differentiation)

**Problem**: Creating category name without real differentiation

**Examples**:
- "AI-powered [existing category]" (AI is feature, not category)
- "Next-generation [existing category]" (marketing speak)
- "Cloud-based [existing category]" (delivery model, not category)

**Why it fails**: Customers see through it, doesn't help positioning

**Fix**: Only create category if fundamentally different approach

---

### Mistake #2: Category Too Narrow

**Problem**: Category is too small to matter

**Example**: "CRM for pet grooming businesses in Ohio"

**Why it fails**: Market too small for ecosystem, investment, growth

**Fix**: Aim for 1,000-10,000+ potential customers minimum

---

### Mistake #3: Category Too Broad

**Problem**: Category name is too generic or encompasses too much

**Example**: "Digital Transformation Platform"

**Why it fails**: Meaningless, everyone claims it, not differentiated

**Fix**: Specific category with clear boundaries

---

### Mistake #4: Not Missionary Selling

**Problem**: Selling product without educating on category

**Why it fails**: Prospects don't understand why they need new category

**Fix**: Lead with problem/category education, not product features

---

### Mistake #5: Inconsistent Category Messaging

**Problem**: Different teams use different category language

**Symptoms**:
- Sales says "revenue platform"
- Marketing says "revenue intelligence"
- Product says "conversation analytics"
- Customers confused about what you are

**Fix**: Align entire company on category name and POV, enforce consistency

---

### Mistake #6: Ignoring Ecosystem

**Problem**: Focus only on your product, not building category

**Why it fails**: Categories need ecosystem to thrive (partners, integrations, community)

**Fix**: Invest in ecosystem development as category-building activity

---

## Part 6: When NOT to Create a Category

**Don't create new category when**:

❌ **You fit well in existing category AND can be top 3**
- Better to dominate existing category than create small one

❌ **Limited resources for multi-year market education**
- Category creation costs $2-5M+ minimum
- Takes 3-7 years to establish

❌ **Short sales cycles required**
- New categories = longer education = longer sales cycles
- If you need quick revenue, use existing category

❌ **Product-market fit not proven**
- Nail product-market fit first
- Category design requires stable product

❌ **Creating category for novelty's sake**
- Only create if it helps positioning/GTM
- Not for press releases or ego

**Instead, consider**:
- Dominating subcategory of existing category
- Big fish, small pond positioning
- Head-to-head with clear differentiation

---

## Part 7: Category Design Resources

### Research & Reports

**Create category-building content**:
- Annual "State of [Category]" report
- Market sizing/trend research
- Customer benchmark studies
- ROI/value research

**Example - Gong**:
- "The State of Revenue Intelligence" (annual)
- "How Top Performers Sell" research
- Conversation analytics benchmarks

---

### Analyst Engagement

**Key analyst firms**:
- Gartner (market leadership)
- Forrester (technology focus)
- G2 (user reviews, category creation)
- IDC (market sizing)

**Engagement strategy**:
- Quarterly briefings on category
- Share customer adoption data
- Request category evaluation
- Sponsor research

---

### Thought Leadership

**Executive visibility**:
- Conference keynotes (own stage at events)
- Podcast interviews (share POV)
- Book authorship (ultimate category credibility)
- Media interviews

**Content cadence**:
- Weekly: Blog posts on category topics
- Monthly: Research/reports
- Quarterly: Major thought leadership pieces
- Annually: Category report
