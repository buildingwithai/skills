# Repositioning Guide

Complete guide to when, why, and how to reposition your product in the market.

## Overview

**What is repositioning**: Deliberately changing how you want your product to be perceived in the market - changing target customer, market category, competitive set, or differentiated value.

**Why companies reposition**:
- Current positioning isn't working (low win rates, long sales cycles)
- Market has shifted (new competitors, changed buyer behavior)
- Product has evolved significantly (new capabilities enable new positioning)
- Stuck in commoditized category (need differentiation)
- Outgrown initial positioning (ready to expand)

**2024 Update**: Repositioning accelerating due to:
- **AI disruption**: Many companies repositioning to incorporate or differentiate from AI
- **Economic pressure**: Companies seeking premium positioning to justify pricing
- **Market saturation**: Crowded categories forcing repositioning for differentiation

**Key insight**: Repositioning is expensive (time, money, confusion risk) but staying with failed positioning is more expensive.

**Success rate**: 60% of repositioning efforts succeed (Gartner 2024) - with proper process, 85%+

## Part 1: When to Reposition

### Signals You Need to Reposition

**Strong signals** (definite repositioning needed):

✅ **Win rates declining** with ICP (used to win 40%, now win 20%)
- Indicates positioning no longer resonates

✅ **Long sales cycles** getting longer (90 days → 180 days average)
- Prospects don't understand value quickly

✅ **"No decision" losses** increasing (>40% of pipeline)
- Not compelling enough to beat status quo

✅ **Price pressure** intensifying (discounting >20% standard)
- Commoditized positioning = price-based competition

✅ **Sales can't explain differentiation** consistently
- Indicates positioning is unclear or weak

✅ **New competitive threats** changing win rates (new entrant taking share)
- Competitive landscape shifted

✅ **Market category shifted** (Gartner/Forrester redefining category)
- Being left behind in old category

✅ **Product evolved significantly** (added major capabilities)
- Current positioning doesn't reflect what you can do

---

**Moderate signals** (investigate, may need repositioning):

⚠️ **Customer confusion** about what you do (RFPs in wrong categories)
⚠️ **Messaging inconsistency** across teams (everyone describes you differently)
⚠️ **Target customer mismatch** (selling to different segment than positioned for)
⚠️ **Competitive comparisons** unfavorable (always compared to cheaper/different solutions)

---

**Weak signals** (monitor, not urgent):

🟡 Feeling like positioning is "stale"
🟡 Competitor launched new positioning
🟡 Wanting to be more innovative/modern

**Warning**: Don't reposition based on weak signals alone. Need data.

---

### When NOT to Reposition

**Don't reposition when**:

❌ **Positioning is working** (hitting win rate, revenue, growth targets)
- If it ain't broke, don't fix it

❌ **Problem is execution, not positioning** (sales not trained, messaging inconsistent)
- Fix execution first

❌ **Just launched current positioning** (<6 months ago)
- Give it time to work

❌ **No product-market fit yet** (< 10 customers, still iterating)
- Too early for formal positioning

❌ **Leadership just wants "refresh"** (no data-driven reason)
- Repositioning for aesthetics wastes resources

❌ **Competitor repositioned** (reactive, not strategic)
- Respond with better execution, not panic repositioning

---

### Repositioning Decision Framework

**Use this decision tree**:

**Question 1**: Are we hitting revenue/win rate targets?
- **Yes** → Don't reposition (optimize execution)
- **No** → Go to Question 2

**Question 2**: Is the problem positioning or execution?
- **Execution** (sales not using positioning, messaging inconsistent) → Fix execution first
- **Positioning** (tested, sales using it, still not working) → Go to Question 3

**Question 3**: Has something fundamental changed?
- **Market** (category shift, new competitors) → Reposition
- **Product** (major new capabilities) → Reposition
- **Customer** (ICP has shifted) → Reposition
- **Nothing fundamental** → Investigate deeper before repositioning

---

## Part 2: Types of Repositioning

### Type 1: Target Customer Repositioning

**What it is**: Changing WHO you position for (different ICP)

**When to use**:
- Current ICP has low win rates/LTV
- Discovered better-fit customer segment
- Want to move upmarket or downmarket
- Reached saturation in current segment

**Example - Slack**:
- **Original**: Small tech startups
- **Repositioned to**: Enterprise teams (2016-2018)
- **Why**: Saturated startup market, enterprise had budget
- **Result**: Grew from $200M to $900M ARR in 3 years

**Implications**:
- New messaging (enterprise vs startup pain)
- New features (security, compliance, admin controls)
- New sales approach (field sales vs self-serve)
- New pricing (enterprise pricing tiers)

---

### Type 2: Market Category Repositioning

**What it is**: Changing WHAT CATEGORY you compete in

**When to use**:
- Current category is commoditized
- Capabilities outgrew original category
- New category emerged that fits better
- Want to create new category

**Example - Databook** (2024):
- **Original**: "Sales Intelligence" (vs ZoomInfo, LinkedIn)
- **Repositioned to**: "Strategic Relationship Management" (new category)
- **Why**: Testing showed real alternative was spreadsheets, not sales intelligence
- **Result**: 10x lead growth, 67% conversion increase

**Implications**:
- New competitive set (different alternatives)
- New differentiation (what makes you unique in new category)
- Market education (teach new category)
- Analyst engagement (get included in new category)

---

### Type 3: Differentiated Value Repositioning

**What it is**: Changing WHAT VALUE you emphasize (same product, different benefits)

**When to use**:
- Current value prop not resonating
- Discovered more compelling benefit
- Competitive advantage shifted
- Market priorities changed

**Example - Zoom** (COVID-19 repositioning):
- **Original**: "Video conferencing for businesses" (efficiency, cost savings)
- **Repositioned to**: "Connection for remote teams" (human connection, culture)
- **Why**: COVID made remote work mandatory, emotional value became primary
- **Result**: 30x growth in 2020

**Implications**:
- New messaging (emphasize different benefits)
- New proof points (different customer stories)
- Same product (no features changed)
- Different positioning

---

### Type 4: Competitive Repositioning

**What it is**: Changing WHO you compete against (competitive alternatives)

**When to use**:
- Losing to unexpected alternatives
- Want to avoid unfavorable comparisons
- New competitive threat emerged
- Status quo is real competitor (not products)

**Example - Notion**:
- **Original**: Positioned against productivity tools (Evernote, OneNote)
- **Repositioned to**: "All-in-one workspace" (vs tool sprawl: Docs + Wiki + Tasks + Databases)
- **Why**: Realized competitive alternative was "too many scattered tools"
- **Result**: Escaped commodity note-taking, became category leader

**Implications**:
- New competitive battlecards
- Different comparison messaging
- May change category
- New sales approach

---

### Type 5: Strategic Narrative Repositioning

**What it is**: Changing THE STORY about market shift and your role

**When to use**:
- Market undergoing transformation
- Want to lead conversation vs follow
- Category is changing
- Need executive-level narrative

**Example - Salesforce** (evolution):
- **2000s**: "No Software" (vs on-premise)
- **2010s**: "Customer Success Platform" (vs CRM)
- **2020s**: "AI for CRM" (vs generic CRM)
- **Why**: Market evolved, leadership required new narrative each era

**Implications**:
- New POV/thought leadership
- Different market education
- Updated strategic messaging
- May not change product immediately

---

## Part 3: The Repositioning Process

### Phase 1: Research & Diagnosis (3-4 weeks)

**Step 1: Quantify the Problem** (Week 1)

Gather data on what's not working:

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Win rate (ICP) | ____% | ____% | ____% |
| Sales cycle length | ____ days | ____ days | ____ days |
| Discount % average | ____% | ____% | ____% |
| "No decision" loss rate | ____% | ____% | ____% |
| Forecast accuracy | ____% | ____% | ____% |

**If gaps > 20%**: Strong signal positioning not working

---

**Step 2: Diagnose Root Cause** (Week 2)

**Interview internal teams**:

**Sales** (10 reps):
- "Why do we win?"
- "Why do we lose?"
- "What's hardest to explain?"
- "Where does positioning break down?"

**Customer Success** (5 CSMs):
- "Do customers understand our value?"
- "What do successful customers get?"
- "What do churned customers say?"

**Product** (3-5 PMs):
- "How has product evolved?"
- "What can we do now that we couldn't before?"
- "Where are capabilities not reflected in positioning?"

**Pattern analysis**: Look for consistent themes

---

**Step 3: External Validation** (Week 3-4)

**Customer interviews** (15-20):
- Best customers (top 20%)
- Recent wins
- Recent losses (churned or lost deals)

**Questions**:
- "How would you describe us to a colleague?"
- "What category do you put us in?"
- "What alternatives did you consider?"
- "Why did you choose us?" (or not)
- "What value do you get?"

**Prospect interviews** (5-10 recent losses):
- "Why didn't you buy?"
- "Who did you choose instead?"
- "How did you categorize us?"
- "What was confusing or unclear?"

**Competitive analysis**:
- How have competitors positioned themselves?
- What categories are they claiming?
- Where are they vulnerable?
- Where are we vulnerable?

---

### Phase 2: Positioning Development (4-6 weeks)

**Use standard positioning process** (see 01-positioning-foundation.md):

1. Competitive alternatives
2. Unique capabilities
3. Differentiated value
4. Best-fit customers
5. Market category

**But with explicit focus on**:
- What's changing from old positioning?
- Why the change?
- How to communicate change?

**Output**: New positioning statement(s)

---

### Phase 3: Testing (2-3 weeks)

**Critical**: Test new positioning before full launch

**Test 1: Customer validation** (10-15 customers)
- Present new positioning
- "Does this resonate?"
- "Is this clearer than before?"
- "Would this have helped your decision?"

**Test 2: Wynter testing** ($899, 12-48 hours)
- Test new messaging with ICP
- Measure: Clarity, Relevance, Value, Differentiation
- Compare to old positioning scores (if available)

**Test 3: Sales pilot** (5-10 prospects)
- Give sales team new positioning
- Use in actual calls
- Gather feedback
- Refine

**Success criteria**:
- ✅ Wynter scores: Clarity 4.0+, Relevance 3.5+, Value 3.5+
- ✅ Sales team: "This is clearer/stronger than before"
- ✅ Customers: "This resonates more than old positioning"

**If tests fail**: Iterate, don't launch weak repositioning

---

### Phase 4: Internal Rollout (3-4 weeks)

**Week 1: Leadership alignment**
- Present new positioning with rationale
- Show test results
- Get buy-in and commitment
- Address concerns

**Week 2: Material updates**
- Website updates (staged)
- Sales deck refresh
- Battlecards updated
- Email templates revised
- Datasheet/collateral updates

**Week 3: Team training**
- Sales training (full day workshop)
- CS training (half day)
- Marketing briefing
- Product alignment

**Week 4: Readiness check**
- All teams can articulate new positioning
- Materials updated
- Launch plan finalized

---

### Phase 5: External Launch (Phased, 2-3 months)

**Month 1: Soft launch**
- Update website
- Train customer-facing teams
- Use in new conversations
- Monitor reception

**Month 2: Active rollout**
- PR announcement (if warranted)
- Customer communication (why repositioning)
- Content refresh (blogs, case studies)
- Ad campaign updates

**Month 3: Full rollout**
- Events/webinars with new positioning
- Analyst briefings
- Customer advocacy program
- Full market presence

---

### Phase 6: Monitor & Iterate (Ongoing)

**Track repositioning impact**:

| Metric | Before | Month 3 | Month 6 | Target |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Win rate | | | | |
| Sales cycle | | | | |
| Discount % | | | | |
| Pipeline velocity | | | | |
| Message clarity (Wynter) | | | | |

**Monthly reviews**: Is repositioning working?

**Adjustments**: Minor tweaks OK, major changes only if data shows failure

---

## Part 4: Common Repositioning Challenges

### Challenge #1: Internal Resistance

**Problem**: Teams resist change ("Old positioning was fine!")

**Why it happens**:
- Comfort with status quo
- Fear of disrupting what works
- Don't see the data showing it's not working

**Solution**:
- **Show data**: Win rates, sales cycles, losses
- **Involve teams**: Workshop approach, not dictate
- **Pilot test**: Let skeptics see results before full rollout
- **Quick wins**: Find early successes to build momentum

**Example**: Sales leader resists repositioning → Give them new positioning for 10 deals, track win rate vs old approach

---

### Challenge #2: Customer Confusion

**Problem**: Existing customers confused by repositioning

**Why it happens**:
- Bought under old positioning
- New positioning doesn't match their understanding
- Fear you're changing product

**Solution**:
- **Communicate early**: "We're not changing product, clarifying positioning"
- **Show value**: "This helps us serve you better"
- **Grandfather**: Existing customers can use old language if preferred
- **CSM prep**: Train CS team to handle questions

**Template email to customers**:
"We're evolving how we describe [Product] to better reflect value you're getting. Product isn't changing, but you may notice updated messaging. Here's what it means..."

---

### Challenge #3: Market Confusion ("Wait, what are you now?")

**Problem**: Market confused by shift

**Why it happens**:
- Abrupt change without explanation
- Inconsistent messaging across channels
- Old content still circulating

**Solution**:
- **Explain the 'why'**: Blog post on repositioning rationale
- **Phased rollout**: Give market time to adjust
- **Consistent messaging**: All channels updated simultaneously
- **FAQ**: Anticipate "Why are you changing?" questions

---

### Challenge #4: Analyst Resistance

**Problem**: Analysts don't recognize new positioning/category

**Why it happens**:
- Analysts have established categories
- Your new category doesn't exist in their taxonomy
- Changing categories takes time

**Solution**:
- **Early engagement**: Brief analysts before launch
- **Provide research**: Data on why new positioning
- **Customer evidence**: Show customers embrace new positioning
- **Patience**: Takes 12-24 months for analyst reports to reflect

---

### Challenge #5: Repositioning Mid-Sales-Cycle

**Problem**: Deals in pipeline under old positioning

**Why it happens**:
- Repositioning doesn't pause sales
- Prospects engaged with old messaging

**Solution**:
- **Staged approach**: New leads get new positioning, existing pipeline finishes with old
- **Sales choice**: Let reps choose which positioning works for active deal
- **Transition guide**: How to shift mid-cycle if helpful

---

## Part 5: 2024 Repositioning Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Intercom - Messaging to Customer Service Platform

**Timeline**: 2020-2024

**Original positioning** (2011-2020):
- Category: "Customer Messaging"
- ICP: Marketing teams, growth teams
- Value: Talk to customers throughout lifecycle
- Competitive set: Drift, Qualified, other chat tools

**Signals repositioning needed**:
- Commoditization of live chat (everyone had it)
- Price pressure (competing on price)
- Enterprise deals lost to Zendesk (customer service category)
- Product evolved (added ticketing, help desk features)

**New positioning** (2020+):
- Category: "Customer Service Platform"
- ICP: Customer support teams (not marketing)
- Value: Complete customer service solution (not just chat)
- Competitive set: Zendesk, Freshdesk (not chat tools)

**Repositioning process**:
1. Realized best customers used Intercom for support (not marketing)
2. Added support features (tickets, SLAs, reporting)
3. Tested new positioning with existing customers (positive)
4. Phased rollout over 18 months
5. Rebranded pricing/packaging around support use cases

**Results**:
- Average deal size +85% (support budgets > marketing budgets)
- Win rate vs Zendesk improved 30 percentage points
- Enterprise wins increased 3x
- Escaped chat tool commoditization

**Key lesson**: Follow your best customers (they showed the repositioning path)

### Case Study 2: Figma - Design Tool to Collaborative Design Platform

**Timeline**: 2016-2021

**Original positioning** (2016-2018):
- Category: "Browser-based design tool"
- ICP: Individual designers
- Value: Design in browser (vs desktop apps)
- Competitive set: Sketch, Adobe XD

**Signals repositioning needed**:
- Teams adopting Figma together (not individuals)
- Collaboration features most-used (not browser aspect)
- Competitive differentiation shifted (Sketch went to browser too)
- Enterprise interest (design systems, team workflows)

**New positioning** (2019-2021):
- Category: "Collaborative Design Platform"
- ICP: Design teams (not individuals)
- Value: Design together in real-time
- Competitive set: Siloed design tools, version control chaos

**Repositioning process**:
- Observed usage patterns (multiplayer sessions, commenting, design systems)
- Doubled down on collaboration features
- Shifted messaging from "browser-based" to "collaborative"
- Enterprise focus (design systems, team management)

**Results**:
- Team plans became majority of revenue
- Enterprise adoption accelerated (Uber, Airbnb, Microsoft)
- $20B Adobe acquisition offer (2022) - validated positioning
- Became category leader in collaborative design

**Key lesson**: Product usage reveals true positioning (not your original intent)

---

### Case Study 3: Airtable - Spreadsheet to Low-Code Platform

**Timeline**: 2020-2024

**Original positioning** (2012-2020):
- Category: "Database-spreadsheet hybrid"
- ICP: Small teams, project management
- Value: Flexible databases without technical setup
- Competitive set: Spreadsheets, Trello, Asana

**Signals repositioning needed**:
- Enterprise customers building apps (not just databases)
- No-code/low-code category exploding
- Stuck in project management commodity space
- Revenue growth slowing

**New positioning** (2021-2024):
- Category: "Low-Code Platform" (later "Connected Apps Platform")
- ICP: Enterprise business operations teams
- Value: Build custom apps without developers
- Competitive set: Custom development, Salesforce Platform

**Repositioning process**:
- Product additions (automations, scripting, interfaces)
- Reframed databases as "app building blocks"
- Enterprise focus (governance, security, scale)
- New pricing (platform pricing vs spreadsheet pricing)

**Results**:
- Average deal size 10x increase
- Enterprise customer growth 5x
- Escaped commodity positioning
- Premium pricing sustainable

**Key lesson**: Reposition to where market value is (enterprise/platform vs consumer/tool)
