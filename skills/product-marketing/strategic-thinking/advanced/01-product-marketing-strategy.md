[Product] is [category] that [key benefit].
Unlike [alternatives], we [unique differentiator].

```

### Product-Led vs Sales-Led GTM

**Product-Led Growth (PLG)**:
- Self-serve onboarding
- Free trial or freemium model
- Value before capture
- Viral/network effects
- Lower touch, higher volume

**Best for**: SMB/mid-market, simple products, low friction adoption

**Sales-Led Growth (SLG)**:
- High-touch sales process
- Demo-based evaluation
- Custom pricing
- Implementation support
- Higher touch, lower volume

**Best for**: Enterprise, complex products, customization needed

**Hybrid Model** (increasingly common in 2024):
- PLG for acquisition
- SLG for expansion
- Example: Land with self-serve, expand with sales

## Product Positioning Strategy

**Positioning = How you want to be perceived in customers' minds relative to alternatives**

### Strategic Positioning Framework

**Step 1: Define Your Category**

**Category creation** vs **Category entry**:
- **Category entry**: "We're a CRM" (existing category)
- **Category creation**: "We're a Revenue Operations Platform" (new category)

**Strategic choice**:
- Enter existing category = Easier for customers to understand, harder to differentiate
- Create new category = Harder to explain, easier to own if successful

**Step 2: Identify Competitive Set**

Who are you positioning against?
- Direct competitors (same product type)
- Indirect competitors (different solution to same problem)
- Status quo (what customers do today)

**Step 3: Determine Points of Difference**

**POD Framework**:
- **Relevant**: Customers care about this difference
- **Distinctive**: Competitors can't or don't offer it
- **Deliverable**: You can actually provide it consistently
- **Communicable**: You can explain it simply

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Only platform with native AI-powered insights"
- ✅ "5x faster implementation than competitors"
- ✅ "Built specifically for healthcare (HIPAA-compliant by design)"

**Step 4: Establish Points of Parity**

**POP**: Things you must match competitors on (table stakes)
- If you lack POPs, customers won't consider you
- Examples: Security, uptime, integrations, support

**Strategic principle**: Achieve parity on POPs, differentiate on PODs

**Step 5: Craft Positioning Statement**

**Template**:
```
For [target customer]
Who [need/opportunity statement],
[Product name] is a [category]
That [key benefit/point of difference].
Unlike [competitors],
[Product name] [unique differentiator/proof].
```

**Example**:
```
For mid-market product marketing managers
Who need competitive intelligence to win more deals,
CompeteIQ is an AI-powered competitive intelligence platform
That automates competitor tracking and delivers actionable battlecards.
Unlike Klue and Crayon built for large enterprises,
CompeteIQ is designed for lean PMM teams with self-serve simplicity and mid-market pricing.
```

### Positioning Testing

**How to validate positioning**:
1. **Customer interviews**: Do customers describe you this way?
2. **Win/loss analysis**: Does positioning resonate in sales cycles?
3. **Message testing**: A/B test positioning in campaigns
4. **Analyst feedback**: Do industry analysts agree with your positioning?
5. **Competitive response**: Are competitors reacting to your positioning?

## Competitive Strategy

**Strategic principle**: Don't just react to competitors—proactively position to win.

### Competitive Strategy Framework

**Step 1: Map Competitive Landscape**
- Use Porter's Five Forces (see module 02)
- Create perceptual map showing positioning
- Identify white space (gaps in market)

**Step 2: Choose Competitive Strategy**

**Three approaches**:

**1. Head-to-head**: Compete directly on same dimensions
- Use when: You have clear advantages
- Risk: Expensive, may start price wars
- Example: Zoom vs. Webex on ease of use

**2. Differentiation**: Compete on different dimensions
- Use when: You can create unique value
- Risk: Customers may not value your difference
- Example: Apple vs. PC on design/experience

**3. Niche focus**: Dominate a specific segment
- Use when: You can serve segment better than generalists
- Risk: Segment may be too small
- Example: Rolex (luxury watches only)

**Step 3: Develop Trap-Setting Messaging**

**"Landmine" questions**: Questions that expose competitor weaknesses
- Ask during sales process
- Highlight your strengths, their weaknesses

**Template**:
```
When evaluating [category solutions], make sure to ask:
1. [Question that exposes Competitor A weakness]
2. [Question that exposes Competitor B weakness]
3. [Question that highlights your strength]
```

**Example**:
```
When evaluating competitive intelligence platforms, ask:
1. "Is this built for enterprise or can it work for my 5-person PMM team?"
   (Klue/Crayon are enterprise-focused)
2. "Can I set this up myself in one day or does it require professional services?"
   (Competitors require IT involvement)
3. "Does the AI actually write my battlecards or just aggregate data?"
   (Our unique AI capability)
```

**Step 4: Create Battlecards**

**Battlecard template** (one-page):

```
COMPETITOR: [Name]

QUICK FACTS:
- Founded: [Year]
- Size: [Employees/Revenue]
- Focus: [Market/segment]

OVERVIEW:
[2-3 sentence description]

THEIR STRENGTHS (What they do well):
• [Strength 1]
• [Strength 2]
• [Strength 3]

THEIR WEAKNESSES (Where they fall short):
• [Weakness 1]
• [Weakness 2]
• [Weakness 3]

OUR ADVANTAGES (How to beat them):
• [Advantage 1]: [Proof point]
• [Advantage 2]: [Proof point]
• [Advantage 3]: [Proof point]

TRAP-SETTING QUESTIONS:
1. [Question that highlights their weakness]
2. [Question that highlights our strength]

OBJECTION HANDLING:
"What if they say: '[Objection]'?"
Response: "[How to handle]"

PROOF POINTS:
• Customer win: [Company that chose us over them]
• [Metric]: [Better performance data]

WHY WE WIN:
[One sentence summary of why we beat them]
```

## Product-Led Growth Strategy

**PLG = Product is primary driver of acquisition, expansion, and retention**

### PLG Strategic Framework

**Core PLG Principles** (2024):
1. **Value before capture**: Let users experience value before paying
2. **Self-serve onboarding**: No sales calls required to get started
3. **Time to value**: Reach "aha moment" quickly (ideally <30 mins)
4. **Product-qualified leads (PQLs)**: Usage signals buying intent
5. **Expansion from within**: Users invite colleagues, expand usage

### PLG Strategy Components

**1. Freemium vs. Free Trial**

**Freemium**:
- Free tier forever
- Upgrade for advanced features
- Example: Slack, Figma, Notion

**Free Trial**:
- Full access for limited time
- Converts to paid or access removed
- Example: Netflix, Salesforce

**Strategic choice depends on**:
- Product complexity
- Time to value
- Viral potential
- Competitive landscape

**2. Onboarding Strategy**

**Goals**:
- Reach "aha moment" fast
- Demonstrate core value
- Create engagement habits

**Framework**:
```
Step 1: Welcome & Context (why they signed up)
Step 2: Setup (minimum required to get started)
Step 3: Quick Win (experience value immediately)
Step 4: Core Workflow (complete primary use case)
Step 5: Habit Formation (return regularly)
```

**3. PQL Definition**

**Product-Qualified Lead**: User who has experienced product value and shows buying signals.

**Example PQL criteria**:
- Used product 10+ times
- Invited 3+ teammates
- Hit usage limit of free plan
- Engaged with premium feature

**4. Expansion Strategy**

**Land and expand**:
- Land: Individual user or small team
- Expand: Department-wide adoption
- Expand: Enterprise-wide deployment

**Expansion motions**:
- Usage-based pricing (more usage = more revenue)
- Team/seat expansion
- Feature upsells
- Add-on products
