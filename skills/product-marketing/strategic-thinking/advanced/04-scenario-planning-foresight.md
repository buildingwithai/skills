## Strategic Foresight Overview

**Strategic foresight**: Systematic approach to anticipating future developments and preparing organizations for long-term success.

**Key difference from forecasting**:
- **Forecasting**: Predict single future based on past trends
- **Foresight**: Explore multiple plausible futures to enhance decision-making

**When to use foresight**:
- Long-term strategic planning (5-10 years)
- High uncertainty environments
- Disruptive technology or market changes
- Major strategic decisions with long-term impact
- Building organizational resilience

### Four Core Foresight Methods

**1. Horizon Scanning**: Detecting early signals of change
**2. Megatrends Analysis**: Understanding large-scale shifts over time
**3. Scenario Planning**: Developing multiple future scenarios
**4. Backcasting**: Working backwards from desired future

## Scenario Planning Framework

**What it is**: Method for exploring plausible futures to test strategies under different conditions

**Famous example**: Royal Dutch Shell used scenarios since 1970s to prepare for oil crises, giving them competitive advantage

### How to Conduct Scenario Planning

**Step 1: Define Focal Question**

What strategic question are you exploring?

**Examples**:
- "How should we position our product in 5 years?"
- "Should we enter the enterprise market?"
- "What business model will succeed in 2030?"

**Step 2: Identify Key Uncertainties**

What factors could significantly impact the future but are uncertain?

**Categories to explore**:
- **Technology**: What tech could emerge or fail?
- **Market**: How could customer needs evolve?
- **Competition**: Who might enter or exit market?
- **Regulation**: What policies could change?
- **Economics**: Recession, growth, inflation?
- **Society**: Demographic or cultural shifts?

**Brainstorm**: List 20-30 uncertainties, then prioritize

**Step 3: Select Critical Uncertainties**

Choose 2-3 most important AND most uncertain factors

**Prioritization matrix**:

```
         High Uncertainty
               ↑
               │
   Interesting │ Critical
   but not     │ (Use these
   critical    │ for scenarios)
               │
───────────────┼───────────────→
               │         High Impact
   Predictable │ Uncertain
   (Incorporate│ but low
   as givens)  │ impact
               │
               ↓
         Low Uncertainty
```

**Example**: B2B SaaS company in 2025

**Critical uncertainties selected**:
1. **AI adoption speed**: Fast vs. Slow
2. **Economic conditions**: Growth vs. Recession

**Step 4: Develop Scenario Framework**

Create 2x2 matrix with your two most critical uncertainties

```
                Fast AI Adoption
                       ↑
                       │
        SCENARIO 2     │     SCENARIO 1
      "AI Boom Times"  │   "AI Recession"
                       │
Recession  ←───────────┼───────────────→  Growth
                       │
        SCENARIO 3     │     SCENARIO 4
     "Slow & Painful"  │   "Traditional
                       │    Growth"
                       ↓
                Slow AI Adoption
```

**Step 5: Build Out Each Scenario**

For each quadrant, develop detailed narrative

**Scenario template**:

```
SCENARIO NAME: [Memorable, descriptive name]

SUMMARY (1-2 sentences):
[What defines this future]

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- [Characteristic 1]
- [Characteristic 2]
- [Characteristic 3]

IMPLICATIONS FOR US:
- Opportunities: [What would work well]
- Threats: [What would be challenging]
- Required capabilities: [What we'd need]

STRATEGIC ACTIONS IN THIS SCENARIO:
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]
- [Action 3]

EARLY WARNING SIGNALS:
- [Signal 1 that this scenario is emerging]
- [Signal 2 that this scenario is emerging]
```

**Example Scenario**:

```
SCENARIO 1: "AI Recession" (Fast AI + Economic Downturn)

SUMMARY:
AI adoption accelerates but economic recession causes budget cuts,
creating pressure for AI-driven efficiency.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Companies desperate to cut costs with AI automation
- High AI tool competition, price pressure
- Customers want ROI proof, short time-to-value
- Consolidation in market (M&A activity)

IMPLICATIONS FOR US:
- Opportunities:
  • Position as cost-reduction solution
  • Fast ROI messaging resonates
  • Automation features are table stakes

- Threats:
  • Price pressure, margin compression
  • Longer sales cycles despite urgency
  • Churn if we don't deliver fast value

- Required capabilities:
  • Strong AI features
  • Proven ROI case studies
  • Efficient go-to-market (low CAC)

STRATEGIC ACTIONS:
- Build AI automation features now
- Develop ROI calculator and proof points
- Optimize for product-led growth
- Focus on core market, avoid expensive expansion
- Build cash reserves

EARLY WARNING SIGNALS:
- AI funding increases dramatically
- Economic indicators decline (GDP, employment)
- Customers asking for AI + ROI proof
```

**Step 6: Identify No-Regret Moves**

What actions work well across ALL scenarios?

**Examples**:
- Build core AI capabilities (works in any AI future)
- Strengthen customer relationships (always valuable)
- Maintain financial flexibility (helps in any economy)

**Step 7: Define Contingency Plans**

What would trigger a shift in strategy?

**If-Then planning**:

```
IF [Scenario 1 signals emerge]:
THEN [Execute Scenario 1 strategy]

IF [Scenario 2 signals emerge]:
THEN [Execute Scenario 2 strategy]

Example:
IF (AI adoption speeds up + economy slows):
THEN (Accelerate AI features, emphasize ROI, cut discretionary spend)

IF (AI adoption stays slow + economy grows):
THEN (Focus on traditional differentiation, premium positioning, expand market)
```

**Step 8: Monitor and Adapt**

Review quarterly:
- Which scenario is emerging?
- What new signals appeared?
- Should we update scenarios?
- Is it time to pivot strategy?

## Horizon Scanning

**What it is**: Systematically detecting early signals of change in the present that could impact the future

**Purpose**: Spot trends, disruptions, and opportunities before they're obvious

### How to Conduct Horizon Scanning

**Step 1: Define Scanning Scope**

What areas matter for your strategy?
- Your industry
- Adjacent industries
- Customer industries
- Technology landscape
- Regulatory environment
- Social/cultural trends

**Step 2: Set Up Information Sources**

**Primary sources**:
- Industry publications and news
- Research reports (Gartner, Forrester, etc.)
- Academic research
- Patent filings
- Startup funding (Crunchbase, PitchBook)
- Social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit)
- Conferences and events

**Scanning frequency**:
- Daily: Industry news, social media
- Weekly: Research reports, deep dives
- Monthly: Synthesis and pattern identification
- Quarterly: Strategic implications assessment

**Step 3: Identify Weak Signals**

**Weak signals**: Early, ambiguous signs of potential change

**Examples of weak signals**:
- New startup in your space raises $50M
- Customer asking for unusual feature
- Regulatory discussion in another country
- Technology breakthrough in research lab
- Unexpected partnership announced

**vs. Strong signals**: Obvious trends everyone sees

**Step 4: Analyze Patterns**

Look for:
- **Converging trends**: Multiple signals pointing same direction
- **Diverging trends**: Contradictory signals (uncertainty)
- **Emerging themes**: New patterns appearing
- **Accelerating trends**: Changes speeding up

**Step 5: Assess Strategic Implications**

For each signal/trend:

```
SIGNAL: [Description]

IMPACT IF IT MATERIALIZES:
- High / Medium / Low

LIKELIHOOD:
- High / Medium / Low

TIMEFRAME:
- 1-2 years / 3-5 years / 5-10 years

STRATEGIC IMPLICATION:
- Opportunity or Threat?
- How should we respond?
- When should we act?

ACTION:
- Monitor (watch for more signals)
- Explore (run small experiment)
- Prepare (build capability)
- Execute (take action now)
```
