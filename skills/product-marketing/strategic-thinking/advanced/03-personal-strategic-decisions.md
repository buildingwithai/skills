## Personal Strategy Framework

**Key principle**: Apply the same strategic thinking frameworks to personal decisions as you would to business decisions.

**Personal strategy process**:
1. **Assess current state**: Where are you now? (Personal SWOT)
2. **Define vision**: Where do you want to be? (3-5 years out)
3. **Set strategic goals**: What will success look like?
4. **Make trade-offs**: What will you say NO to?
5. **Execute with focus**: How will you get there?
6. **Measure and adapt**: Track progress and adjust

## Career Strategic Planning

### Personal SWOT Analysis

**Apply SWOT to your career**:

```

```

         /|\
        / | \
       /  |  \
      /   |   \
     ○────●────○
  SKILLS   ▲   MARKET

         HERE

● = Alignment of all three = Career fulfillment + success
```

**Strategic questions**:
- Where do your values, skills, and market demand overlap?
- What's misaligned today?
- What do you need to develop or change?

### Five-Step Career Decision Process

**Step 1: Self-Assessment**
- Values: What matters most?
- Skills: What am I good at?
- Interests: What energizes me?
- Personality: What environments fit me?
- Constraints: What limitations do I have? (location, salary, etc.)

**Step 2: Explore Options**
- Research roles and industries
- Talk to people doing jobs you're interested in
- Identify multiple paths (not just one)

**Step 3: Evaluate Options**

**Criteria matrix**:

```
Criterion              | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C
───────────────────────|───────|──────────|──────────|─────────
Alignment with values  |  30%  |    8     |    6     |    9
Uses my strengths      |  25%  |    7     |    9     |    6
Growth opportunity     |  20%  |    9     |    5     |    8
Compensation           |  15%  |    7     |    7     |    6
Work-life balance      |  10%  |    6     |    8     |    7
───────────────────────|───────|──────────|──────────|─────────
Weighted Total         | 100%  |   7.5    |   7.0    |   7.4

Scale: 1-10 (10 = best)
```

**Step 4: Make Decision**
- Use decision frameworks from module 04
- Consider reversibility (can you change later?)
- Set decision deadline
- Commit to choice

**Step 5: Create Action Plan**
- What needs to happen to pursue this path?
- What skills to develop?
- What network connections to make?
- What timeline?

## Major Career Decisions

### Decision: Grad School vs. Job vs. Skill Building

**Common scenario**: "Should I get my master's degree or start working?"

**Strategic framework**:

**Option A: Graduate School**

**PROS**:
- Credential and network
- Structured learning
- Career pivot opportunity
- Time to explore without pressure

**CONS**:
- Expensive ($50K-$200K+ cost)
- Opportunity cost (2 years not earning)
- May not increase earning potential significantly
- Delays real-world experience

**Best if**:
- Need credential for target role (MBA for consulting, MS for technical roles)
- Want to pivot industries/functions
- Have limited work experience (need signal of competence)
- Target role requires advanced degree

**Option B: Accept Job Offer**

**PROS**:
- Immediate income
- Real-world experience
- Build professional network
- No debt

**CONS**:
- May lack credential for future roles
- Less structured learning
- Harder to pivot later
- May get stuck in operational work

**Best if**:
- Have clear career path without advanced degree
- Job offer is strong (company, role, compensation)
- Can learn on the job
- Want to avoid debt

**Option C: Skill Building (self-directed learning + interviewing practice)**

**PROS**:
- Targeted skill development
- Lower cost than grad school
- Faster than degree (3-6 months vs. 2 years)
- Can build portfolio while learning

**CONS**:
- No credential
- Requires self-discipline
- No built-in network
- May not be enough for some roles

**Best if**:
- Have clear skill gaps to address
- Target roles don't require degree
- Strong self-learner
- Need to improve interviewing skills

**Decision framework**:

```
Question                                    | Grad School | Job | Skill Building
────────────────────────────────────────────|──────────── |─────|───────────────
Do target roles require advanced degree?   | Yes         | No  | No
Do I need to pivot industries/functions?   | Yes         | No  | Maybe
Can I afford tuition + opportunity cost?   | Yes         | N/A | N/A
Is the job offer strong?                   | N/A         | Yes | N/A
Do I have 6+ months runway?                | Yes         | N/A | Yes
Am I confident in interview skills?        | N/A         | Yes | No
────────────────────────────────────────────|─────────────|─────|───────────────

Count "Yes" answers to see which path aligns best
```

**Example decision**:
- **Scenario**: Product marketer with 3 years experience, considering MBA
- **Goal**: Become VP of Product Marketing
- **Analysis**: VPs typically don't require MBA; experience matters more
- **Decision**: Take strong PMM role at growing company instead of MBA
- **Rationale**: Save $150K + 2 years; gain leadership experience faster

### Decision: Stay vs. Leave Current Role

**Strategic framework**:

**Stay if**:
- ✅ Learning and growing
- ✅ Good manager and team
- ✅ Career progression path clear
- ✅ Compensation competitive
- ✅ Company trajectory positive
- ✅ Work aligns with values

**Leave if**:
- ❌ Stagnated (no growth for 12+ months)
- ❌ Toxic culture or bad manager
- ❌ No clear path to next level
- ❌ Significantly underpaid (20%+ below market)
- ❌ Company struggling (layoffs, declining, etc.)
- ❌ Work misaligned with values

**Decision matrix**:

```
Factor                  | Stay Score | Leave Score | Winner
────────────────────────|────────────|─────────────|────────
Growth opportunity      |     6      |      9      | Leave
Compensation            |     7      |      8      | Leave
Team/Manager quality    |     9      |      7      | Stay
Company trajectory      |     5      |      8      | Leave
Work-life balance       |     8      |      7      | Stay
Values alignment        |     7      |      7      | Tie
────────────────────────|────────────|─────────────|────────
TOTAL (unweighted)      |    42      |     46      | LEAVE

Add weights based on what matters most to you
```

**Strategic timing**:
- **Stay 1-2 years minimum** (unless toxic) to build track record
- **Peak leaving time**: After major accomplishment (launch, promotion, project)
- **Don't leave**: During economic downturn without offer in hand

## Building Personal Competitive Advantage

**Strategic principle**: Build career moats that make you uniquely valuable

### Four Types of Career Moats

**1. Specialized Expertise**
- Deep knowledge in niche area
- Example: "AI-powered product marketing" vs. generic PMM
- Build by: Focus on emerging areas, become the expert

**2. Unique Combination of Skills**
- Rare skillset combinations
- Example: "Technical PMM with data science background"
- Build by: T-shaped skills (deep in one, broad in others)

**3. Strong Network**
- Relationships in your industry/function
- Access to opportunities others don't have
- Build by: Help others, stay connected, give before asking

**4. Proven Track Record**
- Demonstrated results and impact
- Portfolio of successful projects
- Build by: Document wins, get testimonials, share case studies

### Strategic Skill Development

**Which skills to develop?**

**Framework**:

```
             High Market Demand
                    ↑
                    │
    [Acquire Fast]  │  [Your Priority]
    (Trending)      │  (Strategic)
                    │
    ────────────────┼────────────────→
                    │         High Personal Fit
    [Ignore]        │  [Develop Long-term]
    (Saturated)     │  (Foundational)
                    │
                    ↓
             Low Market Demand
```

**Strategic prioritization**:
1. **High demand + High fit**: Focus here (your strategic advantage)
2. **High demand + Low fit**: Acquire minimum viable competence
3. **Low demand + High fit**: Hobby or passion project
4. **Low demand + Low fit**: Ignore

**Example**: Product marketer in 2024
- **High demand + High fit**: AI product marketing, data storytelling
- **High demand + Low fit**: Engineering skills (learn basics, not deep)
- **Low demand + High fit**: Traditional advertising (passion project if interested)
- **Low demand + Low fit**: Outdated tools (ignore)

### Career Vision & Goals

**3-Year Career Vision Template**:

```
VISION (3 years from now):

Role: [Title and level you want]

### Work-Life Trade-offs
