## Framework Overview

Strategic analysis frameworks help you:
- **Understand your current position**: Strengths, weaknesses, competitive dynamics
- **Identify opportunities and threats**: Market trends, emerging competitors, disruptions
- **Make informed decisions**: Based on structured analysis, not just intuition
- **Communicate insights**: Frameworks create shared language for strategic discussions

**Key principle**: Frameworks are thinking tools, not rigid formulas. Adapt them to your context and combine multiple frameworks for comprehensive analysis.

## SWOT Analysis

**When to use**: Quick assessment of current position, strategy kickoff, annual planning

**What it is**: Structured analysis of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats

### How to Conduct SWOT Analysis

**Step 1: Define scope**
- What are you analyzing? (Product, business, feature, career, initiative)
- What timeframe? (Current state, next quarter, next year)
- Who should participate? (Individual, team, cross-functional)

**Step 2: Gather internal factors** (Strengths and Weaknesses)

**Strengths**: Internal attributes that give you advantage
- What do you do better than competitors?
- What unique resources or capabilities do you have?
- What do customers cite as reasons they choose you?
- What assets or intellectual property do you own?

**Example questions**:
- What's our strongest competitive differentiator?
- What capabilities could we leverage more?
- What relationships or partnerships are valuable?

**Weaknesses**: Internal limitations that put you at disadvantage
- What do competitors do better than you?
- What resources or capabilities are you missing?
- What do customers complain about?
- What causes you to lose deals?

**Example questions**:
- Where do we consistently underperform?
- What gaps in our product/team/capabilities exist?
- What would we change if we could start over?

**Step 3: Identify external factors** (Opportunities and Threats)

**Opportunities**: External conditions you could exploit
- What market trends favor your approach?
- What unmet customer needs exist?
- What gaps in competitive landscape could you fill?
- What technologies or partnerships could accelerate growth?

**Example questions**:
- What's changing in our favor in the market?
- What emerging customer segments could we serve?
- What adjacent markets could we enter?

**Threats**: External conditions that could harm you
- What competitive moves threaten your position?
- What market trends work against you?
- What regulatory or economic changes could hurt you?
- What technologies could disrupt your business?

**Example questions**:
- What keeps you up at night about competition?
- What could make our product/approach obsolete?
- What external forces are outside our control?

**Step 4: Analyze and prioritize**

Create SWOT matrix:

```
INTERNAL          | POSITIVE              | NEGATIVE
FACTORS           | (Helpful)             | (Harmful)
------------------|-----------------------|----------------------
                  | STRENGTHS             | WEAKNESSES
                  | - [List 3-5]          | - [List 3-5]
                  | - Unique capability   | - Resource gaps
                  | - Brand strength      | - Technical debt
                  | - Customer loyalty    | - Limited reach
------------------|-----------------------|----------------------
EXTERNAL          | OPPORTUNITIES         | THREATS
FACTORS           | - [List 3-5]          | - [List 3-5]
                  | - Market growth       | - New competitors
                  | - Emerging segments   | - Price pressure
                  | - Technology trends   | - Regulation
```

**Step 5: Develop strategic actions**

**SO Strategies** (Strengths + Opportunities):
- How can you use strengths to capitalize on opportunities?
- Example: "Use our AI expertise to enter emerging ML tools market"

**WO Strategies** (Weaknesses + Opportunities):
- How can you overcome weaknesses to pursue opportunities?
- Example: "Partner with established brand to enter enterprise market despite our startup status"

**ST Strategies** (Strengths + Threats):
- How can you use strengths to defend against threats?
- Example: "Leverage customer loyalty to prevent churn to new competitor"

**WT Strategies** (Weaknesses + Threats):
- How can you minimize weaknesses and avoid threats?
- Example: "Outsource areas where we're weak to focus on core differentiation"

### SWOT Best Practices

✅ **DO**:
- Be specific and honest (avoid vague statements)
- Gather diverse perspectives (cross-functional input)
- Focus on the most important items (3-7 per quadrant, not 20)
- Update regularly (quarterly for dynamic markets)
- Connect SWOT to specific actions

❌ **DON'T**:
- Confuse weaknesses with threats (internal vs. external)
- List only obvious items (dig deeper for insights)
- Create SWOT and file it away (use it to drive decisions)
- Overestimate strengths or underestimate threats (be realistic)

## Porter's Five Forces

**When to use**: Industry analysis, competitive strategy development, market entry decisions

**What it is**: Framework for understanding competitive intensity and profitability of an industry

### The Five Forces

**1. Competitive Rivalry** (existing competitors)
- How intense is competition among current players?
- How many competitors? How similar are they?
- What's the rate of industry growth?
- What are exit barriers keeping players in the market?

**Analyze**:
- Number of competitors and market concentration
- Product/service differentiation
- Price competition vs. value competition
- Marketing spend and competitive moves

**Strategic implications**:
- High rivalry → Focus on differentiation, find niches, build switching costs
- Low rivalry → Opportunity for profitability, but attracts new entrants

**2. Threat of New Entrants**
- How easy is it for new competitors to enter the market?
- What barriers to entry exist?
- How would incumbents react to new entrants?

**Analyze**:
- Capital requirements (high = barrier)
- Economies of scale (favor incumbents)
- Brand loyalty and switching costs
- Access to distribution channels
- Regulatory requirements
- Proprietary technology or IP

**Strategic implications**:
- Low barriers → Build moats (switching costs, network effects, brand)
- High barriers → Protect barriers, leverage scale advantages

**3. Bargaining Power of Suppliers**
- How much power do suppliers have over you?
- Can they raise prices or reduce quality?

**Analyze**:
- Number of suppliers (few = high power)
- Uniqueness of supplier products/services
- Switching costs to alternative suppliers
- Supplier ability to forward integrate (become competitors)

**Strategic implications**:
- High supplier power → Diversify suppliers, vertical integration, partnerships
- Low supplier power → Negotiate favorable terms, optimize supply chain

**4. Bargaining Power of Buyers** (customers)
- How much power do customers have?
- Can they demand lower prices or better terms?

**Analyze**:
- Customer concentration (few large customers = high power)
- Price sensitivity of customers
- Switching costs for customers
- Product differentiation
- Customer profitability (are margins high enough to sustain pressure?)

**Strategic implications**:
- High buyer power → Differentiate, increase switching costs, serve multiple segments
- Low buyer power → Capture value through pricing, invest in product

**5. Threat of Substitutes**
- What alternatives could customers use instead of your product?
- How easily can customers switch to substitutes?

**Analyze**:
- Availability of substitutes
- Price-performance of substitutes
- Switching costs to substitutes
- Customer propensity to substitute

**Strategic implications**:
- High substitute threat → Differentiate on unique value, increase switching costs
- Low substitute threat → Opportunity for premium pricing, focus on quality

### How to Apply Porter's Five Forces

**Step 1: Assess each force** (rate as Low, Medium, High)

**Step 2: Identify most important forces**
- Which 2-3 forces most impact industry profitability?
- Which forces are changing and how?

**Step 3: Develop strategic responses**

Example analysis for B2B SaaS:

```
Force                        | Rating | Strategic Response
-----------------------------|--------|----------------------------------
Competitive Rivalry          | High   | Differentiate through AI features
Threat of New Entrants       | Medium | Build network effects, high NRR
Supplier Power (cloud, etc.) | Low    | Multi-cloud strategy
Buyer Power                  | High   | Create switching costs, integrations
Threat of Substitutes        | Medium | Expand platform, solve more jobs
```

**Step 4: Combine with SWOT**
- Porter's Five Forces = external environment analysis
- SWOT = internal + external analysis
- Use together for comprehensive view

## PESTEL Analysis

**When to use**: Long-term strategic planning, market entry decisions, scenario planning

**What it is**: Framework for analyzing macro-environmental factors

### The Six Factors

**Political**
- Government stability and policies
- Trade regulations and tariffs
- Tax policies
- Labor laws
- Political risks

**Economic**
- Economic growth rates
- Inflation and interest rates
- Exchange rates and currency stability
- Unemployment levels
- Disposable income trends

**Social**
- Demographics and population trends
- Cultural attitudes and values
- Lifestyle changes
- Education levels
- Social mobility

**Technological**
- Technology adoption rates
- R&D investment
- Automation and AI trends
- Infrastructure quality
- Emerging technologies

**Environmental**
- Climate change impacts
- Sustainability requirements
- Resource scarcity
- Waste management
- Carbon regulations

**Legal**
- Data privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA)
- Industry regulations

- Consumer protection laws
- Employment laws

### How to Conduct PESTEL Analysis

**Step 1: Identify relevant factors**
- List 3-5 items per category that affect your business
- Focus on factors you can't control but must respond to

**Step 2: Assess impact and likelihood**

```
Factor                    | Impact | Likelihood | Timeframe | Response
--------------------------|--------|------------|-----------|----------
AI regulation increases   | High   | High       | 2-3 years | Build compliance
Remote work continues     | Medium | High       | Ongoing   | Expand talent pool
Economic recession        | High   | Medium     | 1-2 years | Diversify customers
```

**Step 3: Identify strategic implications**
- Which factors create opportunities?
- Which pose threats?
- What scenarios should you plan for?

**Step 4: Integrate into strategy**
- Update strategy based on macro trends
- Build flexibility for uncertain factors
- Monitor changes continuously

### PESTEL Best Practices

✅ Focus on factors specific to your industry and geography
✅ Update annually or when major changes occur
✅ Combine with Porter's Five Forces for complete external analysis
✅ Use for scenario planning (what if X factor changes significantly?)

❌ Don't list every possible factor (focus on high-impact items)
❌ Don't ignore uncomfortable factors (face threats directly)
❌ Don't analyze without acting (connect to strategic decisions)

## Competitive Analysis

**When to use**: Positioning decisions, feature prioritization, sales enablement, pricing strategy

### Framework: Competitive Landscape Mapping

**Step 1: Identify competitors**
- **Direct competitors**: Same product, same customers
- **Indirect competitors**: Different product, same job-to-be-done
- **Emerging competitors**: Not competitive yet, but could be
- **Substitute products**: Different approach to same problem

**Step 2: Analyze each competitor**

**Competitor Profile Template**:

```
COMPETITOR NAME: [Name]

Basic Info:
- Founded: [Year]
- Funding: [Amount, stage]
- Size: [Employees, revenue if known]
- Target customers: [Segments they serve]

Product Analysis:
- Core features: [What they offer]
- Unique strengths: [What they do well]
- Gaps/weaknesses: [What they lack]
- Pricing model: [How they charge]

Go-to-Market:
- Positioning: [How they position themselves]
- Key messages: [Main marketing claims]
- Channels: [How they sell/market]
- Differentiators: [What makes them unique]

Strategic Assessment:
- Strengths to watch: [Threats to us]
- Weaknesses to exploit: [Opportunities for us]
- Likely next moves: [What they'll do next]
- How to beat them: [Our strategy]
```

**Step 3: Create comparison matrix**

```
Feature/Attribute | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C
------------------|-----|--------------|--------------|-------------
Feature 1         | ✓✓  | ✓            | ✗            | ✓
Feature 2         | ✓   | ✓✓           | ✓            | ✗
Feature 3         | ✓✓  | ✗            | ✓✓           | ✓
Price range       | $$  | $$           | $$$          | $
Target market     | SMB | Enterprise   | Mid-market   | SMB
Key strength      | [X] | [Y]          | [Z]          | [A]

Legend: ✓✓ = Strong, ✓ = Average, ✗ = Weak/Missing
```

**Step 4: Position yourself**

**Perceptual Map**: Plot competitors on two key dimensions

```
        High Performance
              ↑
              |    Competitor B
              |         🔴
              |
Low Price ←---+---→ High Price
              |
         🔵   |         🔴
          Us  |  Competitor A
              |
              ↓
        Basic Performance
```

**Step 5: Develop differentiation strategy**
- What can you do that they can't or won't?
- Where are they weakest and you strongest?
- What trade-offs will you make that they won't?

## Customer & Market Analysis

### Jobs-to-Be-Done Framework

**When to use**: Product strategy, positioning, feature prioritization

**Core principle**: Customers don't buy products, they "hire" them to do jobs

**How to identify jobs**:

1. **Interview customers**: "What were you trying to accomplish when you bought our product?"
2. **Identify the job**: Functional, emotional, and social jobs
3. **Map the job**: Circumstances, desired outcomes, obstacles

**Jobs-to-Be-Done Statement Template**:

"When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."

**Example**: "When I'm preparing for a customer meeting, I want to quickly find relevant case studies, so I can build credibility and win the deal."

**Strategic application**:
- Build features that help customers complete jobs better
- Position against competitors based on job performance
- Identify new markets (other people with same jobs)

### Market Segmentation

**How to segment markets**:

**1. Demographic**: Age, company size, industry, role, location
**2. Psychographic**: Values, attitudes, lifestyle, goals
**3. Behavioral**: Usage patterns, engagement, purchase behavior
**4. Needs-based**: Different jobs or problems to solve

**Strategic segmentation template**:

```
Segment Name: [Descriptive name]

Size: [Market size, # of potential customers]
Characteristics:
- [Defining attribute 1]
- [Defining attribute 2]
- [Defining attribute 3]

Jobs/Needs:
- [Primary job to be done]
- [Secondary jobs]

Value to us:
- Willingness to pay: [High/Medium/Low]
- Acquisition cost: [High/Medium/Low]
- Lifetime value: [High/Medium/Low]
- Strategic fit: [High/Medium/Low]

How to reach them:
- Channels: [Where they are]
- Messages: [What resonates]
- Objections: [What they worry about]
```

## Systems Thinking

**When to use**: Complex problems, unintended consequences, long-term planning

**Core concepts**:

**1. Interconnections**: Everything affects everything else
- Map relationships between parts of the system
- Identify feedback loops

**2. Feedback Loops**:
- **Reinforcing loops**: Growth or decline accelerates (virtuous or vicious cycles)
- **Balancing loops**: Self-correcting mechanisms that maintain stability

**3. Delays**: Time gaps between cause and effect
- Actions taken today may not show results for months/years
- Plan for delays in your strategy

### How to Apply Systems Thinking

**Step 1: Map the system**

```
[Customer satisfaction] → [Retention] → [Revenue] → [Investment in product]
                             ↑                              |
                             |______________________________|
                          (Reinforcing feedback loop)
```

**Step 2: Identify leverage points**
- Where can small changes create big impacts?
- What feedback loops can you strengthen or weaken?

**Step 3: Anticipate unintended consequences**
- If we do X, what else might happen?
- What second-order and third-order effects should we consider?

**Example**: Aggressive growth strategy
- Direct effect: More customers
- Second-order effect: Support team overwhelmed
- Third-order effect: Customer satisfaction drops, churn increases
- System effect: Growth undermines itself

**Strategic response**: Invest in support scaling BEFORE aggressive growth

## First Principles Thinking

**When to use**: Innovation, challenging industry norms, cost reduction, breakthrough strategies

**Process**:

**Step 1: Identify and define your current assumptions**
- What do we believe must be true?
- What constraints do we accept?

**Step 2: Break down the problem into fundamental truths**
- What is absolutely true?
- What is just "conventional wisdom"?

**Step 3: Create new solutions from scratch**
- If we didn't have these constraints, what would we do?
- What's possible if we rebuild from fundamentals?

**Example: Traditional vs. First Principles**

**Traditional thinking**: "We need sales reps to sell enterprise software"
**First principles**:
- Fundamental truth: Enterprise buyers need to understand value and trust the solution
- Question: Do sales reps uniquely provide this, or are there other ways?
- Insight: Product-led growth with strong self-serve + great product can build trust
- Innovation: PLG motion for enterprise (Slack, Figma model)

## When to Use Which Framework

| Situation | Best Framework(s) |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Starting strategy process** | SWOT → Porter's Five Forces |
| **Understanding industry** | Porter's Five Forces → PESTEL |
| **Product positioning** | Competitive Analysis → JTBD |
| **Market entry decision** | PESTEL → Porter's Five Forces → SWOT |
| **Long-term planning** | PESTEL → Scenario Planning (module 04) |
| **Innovation opportunity** | First Principles → JTBD → Competitive Analysis |
| **Complex problem** | Systems Thinking → First Principles |
| **Annual strategy** | SWOT → Porter's Five Forces → PESTEL |
| **Feature prioritization** | JTBD → Competitive Analysis |

**Best practice**: Combine multiple frameworks for comprehensive analysis
- SWOT provides quick overview
- Porter's Five Forces adds competitive dynamics
- PESTEL captures macro trends
- JTBD ensures customer-centricity
- Systems thinking reveals interconnections

## Next Steps

1. **Choose one framework** to practice this week
2. **Apply it to your current situation** (product, business, career)
3. **Document insights** and share with team
4. **Move to module 03**: Learn how to develop strategy based on your analysis
