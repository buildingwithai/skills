## Strategy to Execution Gap

**The problem**: 67% of well-formulated strategies fail due to poor execution.

**Common execution failures**:
- Strategy stays at executive level, doesn't cascade to teams
- No clear connection between daily work and strategic goals
- Lack of accountability and ownership
- Insufficient resources allocated to strategic priorities
- No mechanism to track progress or adapt

**Solution**: Bridge strategy to execution with OKRs and structured implementation.

## OKRs Framework

**OKR = Objectives and Key Results**

**Objective**: Qualitative goal (what you want to achieve)
**Key Results**: Quantitative metrics (how you'll measure success)

### OKR Structure

**Anatomy of good OKRs**:

```
OBJECTIVE: [Qualitative, inspirational, time-bound]
├─ Key Result 1: [Quantitative, measurable, outcome-based]
├─ Key Result 2: [Quantitative, measurable, outcome-based]
└─ Key Result 3: [Quantitative, measurable, outcome-based]
```

**Example**:

```
OBJECTIVE: Become the leading product marketing platform for mid-market companies

KEY RESULTS:
1. Increase market share from 8% to 15% by Q4
2. Achieve 4.5+ G2 rating with 200+ reviews
3. Win 60% of competitive deals against top 3 competitors
```

### How to Write Good OKRs

**Objectives should be**:
- **Qualitative**: Descriptive and inspirational
- **Action-oriented**: What you will accomplish
- **Ambitious**: Stretch goals, not business-as-usual
- **Time-bound**: Typically quarterly or annual

**Good objective examples**:
- ✅ "Dominate the enterprise market segment"
- ✅ "Deliver exceptional customer experience"
- ✅ "Build world-class product marketing capabilities"

**Bad objective examples**:
- ❌ "Increase revenue" (not inspirational, just a metric)
- ❌ "Do better marketing" (vague, not actionable)
- ❌ "Complete projects on time" (operational, not strategic)

**Key Results should be**:
- **Quantitative**: Numbers, percentages, currency
- **Measurable**: Can definitively say if achieved
- **Outcome-focused**: Results, not activities
- **Achievable but ambitious**: 70% confidence of achieving

**Good key result examples**:
- ✅ "Increase enterprise ARR from $2M to $5M"
- ✅ "Achieve NPS of 50+ (currently 35)"
- ✅ "Launch in 3 new markets generating $500K ARR each"

**Bad key result examples**:
- ❌ "Work on enterprise features" (activity, not outcome)
- ❌ "Improve customer satisfaction" (not quantitative)
- ❌ "Launch new website" (output, not outcome)

### OKR Hierarchy

**Company OKRs** (Annual + Quarterly)
↓ (aligned)
**Department OKRs** (Quarterly)
↓ (aligned)
**Team OKRs** (Quarterly)
↓ (aligned)
**Individual OKRs** (Quarterly, optional)

**Alignment principle**: Lower-level OKRs should contribute to higher-level OKRs.

**Example cascade**:

```
COMPANY OKR:
Objective: Achieve product-market fit in enterprise segment
KR1: Reach $10M enterprise ARR
KR2: Achieve 95% enterprise customer retention
KR3: Win 70% of POCs against competitors

↓ (Product Marketing contributes)

PRODUCT MARKETING OKR:
Objective: Establish category leadership in enterprise market
KR1: Generate 500 enterprise MQLs from demand gen campaigns
KR2: Create enterprise sales enablement achieving 80% rep adoption
KR3: Increase enterprise competitive win rate from 45% to 70%

↓ (PMM individual contributes)

PMM INDIVIDUAL OKR:
Objective: Enable sales team to win enterprise competitive deals
KR1: Launch 5 tier-1 battlecards with 75% sales utilization
KR2: Deliver competitive training to 100% of AEs with 85% certification
KR3: Support 30 competitive deals achieving 65% win rate
```

### OKR Best Practices

**Setting OKRs**:
1. **Start with strategy**: OKRs translate strategy into goals
2. **Limit to 3-5 per level**: Focus is critical
3. **Balance aspirational and committed**: Mix stretch and achievable goals
4. **Ensure team buy-in**: Co-create with teams, don't dictate
5. **Make them public**: Transparency drives accountability

**Tracking OKRs**:
- **Weekly check-ins**: Quick status updates (5-10 mins per team)
- **Monthly reviews**: Deep dives on progress, identify blockers
- **Quarterly reviews**: Grade OKRs, learn, set next quarter's OKRs

**Grading scale**:
- **0.0-0.3**: Red - Need intervention
- **0.4-0.6**: Yellow - At risk, needs attention
- **0.7-1.0**: Green - On track / achieved

**Target**: Aim for 0.7 average (70% achievement)
- Consistently achieving 1.0 = OKRs aren't ambitious enough
- Consistently achieving <0.5 = OKRs are unrealistic or execution issues

**Common OKR Mistakes**:

❌ **Mistake 1**: Confusing OKRs with tasks
- Bad KR: "Launch new website"
- Good KR: "Increase organic traffic from 10K to 30K/month"

❌ **Mistake 2**: Too many OKRs (lack of focus)
- Bad: 8 objectives with 4 KRs each = 32 metrics
- Good: 3 objectives with 3 KRs each = 9 metrics

❌ **Mistake 3**: Set and forget
- Bad: Define OKRs in Q1, review in Q4
- Good: Weekly check-ins, monthly reviews, quarterly grading

❌ **Mistake 4**: Business-as-usual metrics as KRs
- Bad: "Maintain 95% uptime" (operational baseline)
- Good: "Improve page load time from 3s to <1s"

❌ **Mistake 5**: Tying OKRs directly to compensation
- OKRs are stretch goals; compensation linkage discourages ambition
- Better: Use OKRs for alignment, separate metrics for compensation

## Building Strategic Roadmaps

**Roadmap purpose**: Communicate timeline and sequencing of strategic execution.

### Roadmap Components

**1. Time horizons**
- **Now** (Current quarter): Committed work in progress
- **Next** (Next 1-2 quarters): Planned initiatives
- **Later** (3-4 quarters out): Future direction

**2. Strategic themes**
- Group initiatives by strategic pillar
- Examples: Growth, Product Innovation, Operational Excellence, Market Expansion

**3. Major initiatives**
- High-level bodies of work (not detailed features)
- Timeline: When they start and complete
- Dependencies: What must happen first

### How to Build a Roadmap

**Step 1: Start with strategic goals**
- What are the 3-5 strategic objectives for the year?

**Step 2: Identify required initiatives**
- What major work is needed to achieve each objective?

**Step 3: Sequence initiatives**
- What dependencies exist?
- What resources (people, budget, tech) are needed?
- What can run in parallel vs. sequential?

**Step 4: Assign to quarters**
- Q1: What must happen first?
- Q2-Q3: What builds on Q1?
- Q4: What completes the strategy?

**Step 5: Add checkpoints**
- Monthly: Initiative progress reviews
- Quarterly: Strategic roadmap refresh

## Resource Allocation

**Strategic principle**: Allocate resources based on strategic priorities, not equally across all work.

### Resource Allocation Framework

**Step 1: Categorize all work**

**Strategic work** (advances strategic goals):
- Should be 60-70% of resources
- Examples: New market entry, product innovation, competitive positioning

**Operational work** (keeps business running):
- Should be 20-30% of resources
- Examples: Support, maintenance, routine processes

**Exploratory work** (innovation, R&D):
- Should be 10-20% of resources
- Examples: Experiments, prototypes, new technologies

**Step 2: Audit current allocation**
- Where do you actually spend time/money today?
- Does it match strategic priorities?

**Step 3: Reallocate to strategic priorities**

Example:

```
Category          | Current | Target | Gap     | Actions
─────────────────|────────|───────|─────────|─────────────────────
Strategic work   |   40%  |  65%  | +25%    | Add 2 FTEs, reduce meetings
Operational work |   45%  |  25%  | -20%    | Automate, outsource, eliminate
Exploratory work |   15%  |  10%  | -5%     | Focus experiments on strategy
```

**Resource allocation questions**:
- Does our budget reflect our strategic priorities?
- Are our best people working on strategic initiatives?
- What operational work can we automate, outsource, or eliminate?
- What are we doing that doesn't advance strategic goals?

## Stakeholder Alignment

**The problem**: Strategy fails without cross-functional buy-in and alignment.

### Alignment Framework

**Step 1: Map stakeholders**

```
Stakeholder      | Role in Strategy | Influence | Support Level | Engagement Needed
─────────────────|──────────────────|──────────|───────────────|──────────────────
CEO              | Sponsor          | High     | Champion      | Monthly updates
Product VP       | Co-owner         | High     | Neutral       | Weekly collaboration
Sales VP         | Implementer      | High     | Skeptic       | Weekly + training
Marketing VP     | Supporter        | Medium   | Supporter     | Bi-weekly syncs
Finance          | Gatekeeper       | Medium   | Neutral       | Quarterly reviews
```

**Step 2: Develop engagement plan**

**For Champions**: Leverage their advocacy
**For Supporters**: Keep informed and engaged
**For Neutrals**: Build understanding and address concerns
**For Skeptics**: Address objections, show quick wins
**For Blockers**: Understand concerns, find common ground or escalate

**Step 3: Communication cadence**

**Strategic communication plan**:

```
Audience         | Message              | Format          | Frequency
─────────────────|─────────────────────|─────────────────|────────────────
Executive team   | Strategy + results   | Dashboard + mtg | Monthly
All employees    | Strategy overview    | Town hall       | Quarterly
Direct reports   | Tactical execution   | Team meeting    | Weekly
Board            | Strategic progress   | Board deck      | Quarterly
```

### Communication Framework

**Strategy communication should**:
1. **Connect to purpose**: Why does this strategy matter?
2. **Clarify priorities**: What are the 3-5 key goals?
3. **Show progress**: How are we tracking against goals?
4. **Address concerns**: What challenges and how we're addressing them?
5. **Call to action**: What do we need from this audience?

**Template**:

```
