## What is Strategy?

**Strategy is NOT**:
- ❌ A long-term plan
- ❌ A vision statement
- ❌ A list of goals
- ❌ A budget or forecast
- ❌ Operational execution

**Strategy IS**:
- ✅ An integrated set of choices that position you uniquely in your market
- ✅ A theory about how to win
- ✅ Deliberate trade-offs about what to do and what NOT to do
- ✅ Creating sustainable competitive advantage

**Michael Porter's definition**: "Strategy is about making choices, trade-offs; it's about deliberately choosing to be different."

**Good strategy has three components** (Richard Rumelt):
1. **Diagnosis**: Understanding the nature of the challenge
2. **Guiding Policy**: Overall approach to overcome the challenge
3. **Coherent Actions**: Coordinated set of actions to execute the policy

## 6-Step Strategy Development Process

This comprehensive process synthesizes best practices from Harvard Business School, leading consultancies, and modern strategy practitioners.

### Step 1: Assess Current State

**Goal**: Understand where you are today before charting where to go

**Activities**:

**A. Conduct situation analysis**:
- **SWOT Analysis**: Internal strengths/weaknesses, external opportunities/threats (see module 02)
- **Porter's Five Forces**: Industry competitive dynamics
- **PESTEL Analysis**: Macro environmental factors
- **Performance audit**: Current metrics, trends, and results

**B. Gather stakeholder input**:
- Customer interviews and feedback
- Employee/team perspectives
- Leadership alignment on challenges
- Board or investor views

**C. Define the strategic problem**:
- What challenge are we trying to solve?
- What opportunity are we trying to capture?
- What's at stake if we don't address this?

**Output**: Clear diagnosis of current situation and strategic challenge

**Time estimate**: 1-3 weeks depending on scope

### Step 2: Define Vision, Mission & Values

**Goal**: Establish where you're going and why

**Vision**: Aspirational future state (3-10 years)
- What will success look like?
- What impact will you have on customers/market/world?
- How will you be different from today?

**Vision template**:
"By [timeframe], we will [future state description] so that [impact on stakeholders]."

**Example**: "By 2027, we will be the leading AI-powered customer intelligence platform for mid-market B2B companies, helping 10,000+ companies make better strategic decisions through data."

**Mission**: Your fundamental purpose (relatively stable)
- Why do you exist?
- What problem do you solve?
- For whom?

**Mission template**:
"We [what you do] for [who] so they can [outcome]."

**Example**: "We empower product marketers to make data-driven strategic decisions through world-class competitive intelligence and market insights."

**Values**: Guiding principles for how you operate
- What behaviors and decisions align with your culture?
- What trade-offs will you make?
- What won't you compromise on?

**Values format**: 3-5 core values with behavioral descriptions

**Example**:
- **Customer obsession**: We start with customer needs and work backwards
- **Data-driven decisions**: We use evidence, not intuition alone
- **Move fast**: We bias toward action and iterate based on results

**Output**: Clear vision (where), mission (why), and values (how)

**Time estimate**: 1-2 weeks with stakeholder input and alignment

### Step 3: Set Strategic Goals & Objectives

**Goal**: Define what success looks like in concrete, measurable terms

**Characteristics of good strategic goals**:
- **Strategic, not tactical**: 12-36 month horizon, not quarterly tasks
- **Outcome-focused**: Results to achieve, not activities to do
- **SMART**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- **Focused**: 3-5 goals maximum (more = lack of focus)

**Strategic goal template**:
"[Action verb] [metric] from [baseline] to [target] by [date] to [strategic impact]"

**Examples**:
- "Increase enterprise market share from 8% to 15% by Q4 2025 to establish category leadership"
- "Expand into European market generating $5M ARR by end of 2025 to diversify revenue"
- "Achieve 30% product-led growth (PLG) signups by Q2 2025 to reduce CAC"

**Framework: Strategic Goal Categories**

Use 3-5 goals across different categories:

**1. Growth goals**:
- Revenue growth
- Market share expansion
- Customer acquisition
- Geographic expansion

**2. Efficiency goals**:
- Margin improvement
- Cost reduction
- Productivity increase
- Process optimization

**3. Differentiation goals**:
- Product innovation
- Customer satisfaction
- Brand positioning
- Competitive advantage

**4. Foundation goals**:
- Team capabilities
- Technology infrastructure
- Strategic partnerships
- Organizational transformation

**Output**: 3-5 strategic goals with success metrics

**Time estimate**: 1-2 weeks including prioritization and alignment

### Step 4: Develop Strategic Positioning

**Goal**: Define how you'll be unique and win in the market

**Key questions to answer**:
1. **Who will you serve?** (Target customer segments)
2. **What will you offer?** (Value proposition)
3. **How will you deliver it?** (Business model and capabilities)
4. **Why will customers choose you?** (Differentiation)
5. **What will you NOT do?** (Trade-offs)

**A. Target customer definition**

**ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) Template**:

```
Company characteristics:
- Industry: [Specific industries]
- Size: [Employee count / revenue range]
- Geography: [Markets you serve]
- Technology stack: [What they use]

Buyer persona:
- Role: [Job title, department]
- Goals: [What they're trying to achieve]
- Challenges: [Problems they face]
- Decision criteria: [How they evaluate solutions]

Signals they're ready to buy:
- [Trigger event 1]
- [Trigger event 2]
- [Trigger event 3]
```

**B. Value proposition development**

**Value Proposition Formula**:
"For [target customer] who [need statement], our [product/solution] is [category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [alternatives], we [unique differentiator]."

**Example**: "For mid-market product marketing managers who need competitive intelligence to win deals, our platform is an AI-powered CI tool that automates competitor tracking and analysis. Unlike Klue or Crayon built for enterprises, we're designed specifically for lean PMM teams with self-service simplicity and mid-market pricing."

**Value Proposition Canvas** (see detailed section below for visual framework)

**C. Differentiation strategy**

**Three ways to differentiate** (Michael Porter):

**1. Cost Leadership**
- Lowest cost provider in the industry
- Achieve through scale, efficiency, optimization
- Example: Walmart, Southwest Airlines

**Strategic choice**:
- How will you achieve lower costs than competitors?
- Can you sustain cost advantage?
- Will customers choose you based on price?

**2. Differentiation**
- Unique value that customers will pay premium for
- Achieve through innovation, quality, brand, service
- Example: Apple, Tesla, Ritz-Carlton

**Strategic choice**:
- What makes you uniquely valuable?
- Will customers pay for this difference?
- Can competitors copy you easily?

**3. Focus (Niche)**
- Serve specific segment better than generalists
- Achieve through specialization and deep understanding
- Example: Ferrari (luxury sports cars), Rolex (luxury watches)

**Strategic choice**:
- What narrow segment will you dominate?
- Can you build defensibility through specialization?
- Is the segment large enough to sustain you?

**Choose ONE primary strategy** (trying to be all things = strategic failure)

**D. Strategic trade-offs**

**Principle**: Good strategy requires saying NO to attractive opportunities

**Trade-off framework**:

```
IF we choose [Strategic Choice A]
THEN we must NOT [Strategic Choice B]
BECAUSE [Reason / Resource constraint / Positioning conflict]

Example:
IF we choose to serve enterprise customers with high-touch sales
THEN we must NOT also optimize for self-serve SMB product-led growth
BECAUSE these require conflicting product experiences, go-to-market motions, and resource allocation
```

**Critical trade-offs to make explicit**:
- Segments to serve vs. segments to ignore
- Features to build vs. features to delay/skip
- Channels to invest in vs. channels to avoid
- Geographies to enter vs. geographies to defer
- Pricing position (premium vs. volume vs. value)

**Output**: Clear positioning, differentiation strategy, and trade-offs

**Time estimate**: 2-3 weeks including customer research and testing

### Step 5: Design Strategic Initiatives

**Goal**: Translate strategy into coherent, coordinated actions

**Initiative definition**: A major body of work that advances strategic goals (3-12 months)

**How to identify initiatives**:

**Start with strategic goals**, then ask:
- What major initiatives are required to achieve this goal?
- What capabilities do we need to build?
- What changes must we make?

**Example**:

**Strategic Goal**: Increase enterprise market share from 8% to 15% by Q4 2025

**Required initiatives**:
1. Build enterprise features (SSO, advanced permissions, audit logs)
2. Develop enterprise sales motion (hire AEs, create sales playbook)
3. Create enterprise-grade security and compliance certification
4. Establish enterprise customer success program
5. Develop enterprise pricing and packaging

**Initiative template**:

```
Initiative Name: [Descriptive name]

Strategic goal it supports: [Which goal?]

Description: [1-2 sentences of what you'll do]

Success metrics:
- [Metric 1]: [Target]
- [Metric 2]: [Target]

Owner: [Person/team responsible]

Timeline: [Start date] to [End date]

Key milestones:
- [Month/Quarter]: [Milestone]
- [Month/Quarter]: [Milestone]

Resources required:
- Team: [People/roles needed]
- Budget: [Investment required]
- Dependencies: [What else must happen first?]
```

**Prioritization**: Use RICE or ICE scoring (see module 04) to prioritize initiatives

**Output**: 5-10 strategic initiatives with owners, timelines, and resources

**Time estimate**: 2-3 weeks including prioritization and resource planning

### Step 6: Create Strategic Roadmap

**Goal**: Communicate the timeline and sequence of strategy execution

**Roadmap components**:

**A. Timeline view** (by quarter or month)

```
Q1 2025              Q2 2025              Q3 2025              Q4 2025
------------------   ------------------   ------------------   ------------------
[Initiative 1]       [Initiative 1]       [Initiative 3]       [Initiative 5]
• Milestone A        • Milestone B        • Milestone A        • Milestone A

[Initiative 2]       [Initiative 2]       [Initiative 4]       [Initiative 6]
• Milestone A        • Milestone B        • Milestone A        • Milestone B
```

**B. Strategic themes**

Group initiatives by theme:
- **Growth**: Market expansion, customer acquisition
- **Product**: Innovation, differentiation, platform
- **Efficiency**: Cost reduction, process improvement
- **Foundation**: Team, technology, partnerships

**C. Dependencies and sequencing**

- What must happen before other initiatives can start?
- What can run in parallel?
- Where are bottlenecks or resource constraints?

**D. Checkpoints and reviews**

- Monthly: Progress check on active initiatives
- Quarterly: Strategy review and adjustment
- Annually: Comprehensive strategy refresh

**Output**: Visual roadmap with timeline, initiatives, milestones, and reviews

**Time estimate**: 1 week to create and align with stakeholders

## Business Model Canvas

**When to use**: New business strategy, business model innovation, startup strategy

**What it is**: One-page framework for designing or documenting business models

**The 9 building blocks**:

```

**How to use**:

1. **Start with Customer Segments** (right side): Who do you serve?
2. **Define Value Propositions**: What value do you create for them?
3. **Map Channels**: How do you reach customers?
4. **Design Customer Relationships**: How do you interact with customers?
5. **Identify Revenue Streams**: How do you capture value?
6. **Define Key Resources**: What assets do you need?
7. **List Key Activities**: What must you do to deliver value?
8. **Identify Key Partners**: Who helps you deliver?
9. **Outline Cost Structure**: What does it cost to operate?

**Strategic questions from BMC**:
- Are our costs aligned with our revenue model?
- Do our key activities actually support our value proposition?

- What partnerships could improve our model?

## Value Proposition Canvas

**When to use**: Product strategy, positioning, feature prioritization, customer-centric strategy

**What it is**: Tool to ensure your value proposition matches customer needs

**Two sides**:

**Customer Profile (Right side)**:
- **Customer Jobs**: What are customers trying to accomplish?
- **Pains**: What frustrates them, what risks do they face?
- **Gains**: What outcomes and benefits do they want?

**Value Map (Left side)**:
- **Products & Services**: What you offer
- **Pain Relievers**: How you alleviate specific pains
- **Gain Creators**: How you create specific gains

**How to use**:

**Step 1: Create Customer Profile**

**Customer Jobs**:
- Functional jobs: Tasks they need to complete
- Social jobs: How they want to be perceived
- Emotional jobs: How they want to feel

**Pains**:
- Obstacles preventing job completion
- Risks they want to avoid
- Frustrations with current solutions

**Gains**:
- Required outcomes
- Expected outcomes
- Desired outcomes
- Unexpected delighters

**Step 2: Design Value Map**

For each customer pain, design pain relievers:
- How does your product eliminate or reduce this pain?

For each customer gain, design gain creators:
- How does your product produce or maximize this gain?

**Step 3: Achieve Fit**

**Product-Market Fit occurs when**:
- Your pain relievers address the most important customer pains
- Your gain creators deliver the most desired customer gains
- Customers recognize the value and are willing to pay

**Strategic application**:
- Prioritize features based on pain relief and gain creation
- Position based on most important pains you solve
- Test messaging against customer jobs, pains, and gains

## Strategy Canvas

**When to use**: Differentiation strategy, blue ocean strategy, competitive positioning

**What it is**: Visual framework for creating new market space through differentiation

**How to create**:

**Step 1: Identify factors of competition**
- What attributes do competitors compete on?
- What do customers value?

**Step 2: Plot competitive landscape**

```
High   |
Value  |     •Comp A            •Comp B
       |                •Comp C
       |
Low    |___________________________________
       Feature Feature Feature Feature Feature
       A       B       C       D       E
```

**Step 3: Create new value curve**

**Four Actions Framework**:

**ELIMINATE**:
- Which factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?
- What can we stop doing that customers don't value?

**REDUCE**:
- Which factors should be reduced well below industry standard?
- Where are we over-serving and could reduce costs?

**RAISE**:
- Which factors should be raised well above industry standard?
- Where should we over-invest for differentiation?

**CREATE**:
- Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?
- What new value can we deliver?

**Example: Slack (when entering market)**

```
ELIMINATE:
- Email-style threading
- Enterprise IT requirements

REDUCE:
- Formal documentation
- Meeting scheduling needs

RAISE:
- Real-time messaging speed
- Search and findability
- Integration capabilities

CREATE:
- Fun, consumer-grade UX for enterprise
- Emoji reactions and casual tone
- Public/private channel model
```

**Strategic outcome**: Unique value curve that differentiates from competitors
