# Positioning Rollout

Test, align, and launch positioning changes with strategic rigor.

**✨ FOCUS**: Strategic positioning rollout - changes to market category, ICP, differentiation, or competitive positioning.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Test positioning** before internal/external rollout (validation with ICP)
- **Roll out new positioning** internally (category change, repositioning, ICP shift)
- **Align stakeholders** on positioning strategy (executives, product, sales, marketing)
- **Launch positioning externally** (website, analyst relations, thought leadership)
- **Measure positioning effectiveness** (win rates, message clarity, category perception)

**NOT for:**
- Tactical messaging changes (use `messaging-rollout` skill)
- Creating initial positioning (use `positioning` skill first)
- Developing messaging (use `messaging` skill first)

## Prerequisites

### Positioning Must Be Complete

You need finalized positioning before rollout:

✅ **Positioning statement** - Clear target customer, category, differentiated value
✅ **Competitive alternatives** - Know what you're positioning against
✅ **Proof points** - Evidence that validates positioning claims
✅ **Executive sponsorship** - Leadership commitment to positioning change

**If positioning isn't complete:**
→ Use the `positioning` skill to create your positioning foundation
→ Then return here for rollout

## The Positioning Rollout Process

Complete timeline from testing to market adoption:

**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks for full positioning rollout

```
TESTING → INTERNAL ROLLOUT → EXTERNAL LAUNCH → MEASUREMENT
(Week 1-2)  (Week 2-5)         (Week 5-7)        (Week 8+)
```

   - Timeline: Ongoing (monthly reviews)

## Key Principles

### 1. Test Positioning, Not Just Messaging

**Positioning testing asks different questions than message testing:**

**Positioning questions:**
- Do prospects understand what category you're in?
- Is your ICP clear and relevant?
- Can they articulate your differentiation?
- Do you compete against the right alternatives?

**Messaging questions** (different skill):
- Does this headline resonate?
- Is this value prop compelling?
- Do prospects want to learn more?

### 2. Internal Alignment is Critical

**Positioning changes fail without internal buy-in:**

**Why alignment matters:**
- Sales won't sell what they don't understand
- Product won't build to new positioning
- Marketing will revert to old positioning
- Inconsistent positioning confuses market

**Investment required:** 3-4 weeks minimum for internal rollout

### 3. Positioning Rollout ≠ Messaging Launch

**Key distinction:**

**Positioning rollout** (this skill):
- Strategic: Changing how we want to be perceived
- Foundational: Affects all GTM decisions
- Slower: Requires deep organizational change
- Measured by: Win rates, category leadership, sales cycles

**Messaging rollout** (different skill):
- Tactical: Changing how we communicate
- Executional: Affects customer-facing content
- Faster: Update materials and train teams
- Measured by: Message clarity, engagement, conversion

### 4. External Launch Requires Patience

**Positioning changes take time to stick in market:**

**Timeline expectations:**
- Week 1-2: Update owned channels (website, blog)
- Week 3-4: Analyst briefings and thought leadership
- Month 2-3: Consistent positioning in all content
- Month 3-6: Market begins to recognize new positioning
- Month 6-12: Category perception shifts

Don't expect immediate market recognition - positioning is a marathon.

### 5. Measurement Validates Investment

**Track positioning effectiveness rigorously:**

**Leading indicators** (early signals):
- Message clarity scores (4.0+/5 on Wynter)
- Sales team adoption rate (70%+ using new positioning)
- Win rate trends by ICP

**Lagging indicators** (business impact):
- Win rate improvement (target +10-15 points)
- Sales cycle reduction (target -15-25%)
- Premium pricing sustainability

Review monthly, iterate quarterly.

## Typical Timeline

| Activity | Duration | Can Compress? |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Positioning testing (Wynter + interviews) | 1-2 weeks | ✓ Yes, to 1 week (Wynter 12-48hrs) |
| Internal alignment workshops | 3-4 weeks | ⚠️ Risky to compress below 2 weeks |
| External launch (phased) | 2-3 weeks | ⚠️ Not below 2 weeks |
| Measurement setup | 1 week | ✓ Can do in parallel |
| **Total** | **4-8 weeks** | **Absolute minimum: 4 weeks** |

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Skipping positioning testing** → Launch confusing positioning, waste months
2. **Rushing internal alignment** → Teams don't adopt, positioning fails
3. **Big-bang external launch** → No room for iteration, high risk
4. **Confusing positioning with messaging** → Roll out tactics without strategy
5. **No executive sponsorship** → Positioning change is optional, fails
6. **Not measuring** → Can't prove positioning is working (or isn't)
7. **Giving up too early** → Positioning takes 6-12 months to stick in market
