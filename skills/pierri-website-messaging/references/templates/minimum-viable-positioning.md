# Minimum Viable Positioning Worksheet

**Based on**: Anthony Pierri's MVP (Minimum Viable Positioning) framework
**Purpose**: Get to positioning you can test quickly without perfect clarity

---

## The MVP Framework

**Minimum Viable Positioning** requires just 2 elements:
1. One from the **PRODUCT side** (what it is OR what makes it different)
2. One from the **MARKET side** (who it's for OR what use case)

**Philosophy**: Don't wait for perfect positioning. Ship minimum viable positioning and iterate based on real feedback.

## STEP 1: The Four Core Questions

Answer these four questions as best you can right now (even if uncertain):

### Question 1: Who is it for?

**Target customer segment**:


**How specific can you be?**
- [ ] Very specific: "Product designers at remote-first SaaS companies"
- [ ] Somewhat specific: "Design teams at tech companies"
- [ ] Broad: "Design teams"
- [ ] Too broad: "Anyone who designs" ← Go more specific

**Your answer** (pick the most specific you can defend):


---

### Question 2: What is it?

**Product category OR use case description**:


**Which approach fits better?**
- [ ] Category-based: "It's a [CATEGORY]" (e.g., "design tool," "CRM")
- [ ] Use case-based: "It helps you [USE CASE]" (e.g., "design interfaces," "manage customers")

**Your answer**:


---

### Question 3: What makes it different?

**Primary differentiation**:


**What type of differentiation?**
- [ ] Capability-based: "We can do [X] that competitors can't"
- [ ] Approach-based: "We do it [DIFFERENTLY] than competitors"
- [ ] Segment-based: "We're built specifically for [SEGMENT]"

**Your answer**:


---

### Question 4: Why does it matter?

**Primary value/benefit**:


**Be specific**:
- ❌ Bad: "Save time" or "Increase revenue"
- ✅ Good: "Ship features 2x faster" or "Close 30% more deals"

**Your answer**:


---

## STEP 2: Check Your Minimum Viability

Do you have at least TWO of these four elements clearly defined?

- [ ] Who it's for (Question 1)
- [ ] What it is (Question 2)
- [ ] What makes it different (Question 3)
- [ ] Why it matters (Question 4)

**If YES**: You have Minimum Viable Positioning. Continue to Step 3.

**If NO**: You need to answer at least 2 questions before proceeding. Focus on:
- **Product side**: Question 2 (what) OR Question 3 (different)
- **Market side**: Question 1 (who) OR implied in a use case

---

## STEP 3: Build Your MVP Positioning Statement

Use the questions you answered to create a positioning statement:

### Formula 1: WHO + WHAT

**Template**: "The [CATEGORY] for [TARGET CUSTOMER]"

**Example**: "The collaborative design tool for remote teams"

**Your statement**:


---

### Formula 2: WHAT + DIFFERENT

**Template**: "The [DIFFERENTIATION] [CATEGORY]"

**Example**: "The real-time collaborative design tool"

**Your statement**:


---

### Formula 3: WHO + USE CASE

**Template**: "Help [TARGET CUSTOMER] [DO WHAT]"

**Example**: "Help design teams collaborate on interface designs in real-time"

**Your statement**:


---

### Formula 4: WHO + DIFFERENT + WHY

**Template**: "For [WHO], we [DIFFERENT] so you [BENEFIT]"

**Example**: "For design teams, we enable real-time collaboration so you ship 2x faster"

**Your statement**:


---

### Select Your MVP Positioning

**Which formula felt most natural?**


**Your MVP positioning statement**:


---

## STEP 4: Create Your Hero Section (MVP Version)

Turn your positioning into homepage hero copy:

### H1 (Headline)

**Based on your positioning statement**:


**Alternative H1 options**:
1.
2.

---

### H2 (Supporting Copy)

**Add context to your H1**:


**Pattern options**:
- "For [WHO] who [CONTEXT/PROBLEM]"
- "[CAPABILITY] so you [BENEFIT]"
- "[PROBLEM] → [SOLUTION]"

---

### Primary CTA

**What action do you want visitors to take?**


**CTA button copy** (2-3 words):


---

## STEP 5: Test Your MVP Positioning

### The 5-Second Test

**Show your hero section to someone unfamiliar with your product for 5 seconds, then ask**:

1. "What does this product do?"
   - Their answer:
   - Did they get it right? [ ] Yes [ ] No

2. "Who is it for?"
   - Their answer:
   - Did they get it right? [ ] Yes [ ] No

3. "How is it different from alternatives?"
   - Their answer:
   - Did they get it right? [ ] Yes [ ] No

**If 2+ answers are "No"**: Your MVP positioning isn't clear enough. Revise and test again.

---

### The Sales Pitch Test

**Can a salesperson explain your positioning in 30 seconds?**

**Their pitch**:


**Did they include**:
- [ ] Who it's for
- [ ] What it is/does
- [ ] What makes it different
- [ ] Why it matters

**If NO to 2+**: Your positioning isn't internalized. Simplify.

---

### The Customer Recognition Test

**Show your hero section to a target customer. Ask: "Is this for you?"**

**Their response**:


**Did they**:
- [ ] Immediately recognize themselves as the target
- [ ] Understand what the product does
- [ ] See value for their use case

**If NO to any**: Revisit your WHO and WHAT.

---

## STEP 6: Iterate Based on Feedback

### What You Learned

**From testing, what worked?**
-
-
-

**What didn't work?**
-
-
-

**What questions did people ask?**
-
-
-

---

### Positioning Refinements

**Based on feedback, update your positioning**:

**WHO (Target Customer)** - More specific or different segment?


**WHAT (Product Category/Use Case)** - Clearer or different framing?


**DIFFERENT (Differentiation)** - More specific or different angle?


**WHY (Value/Benefit)** - More compelling or different outcome?


---

### Updated MVP Positioning

**V2 positioning statement**:


**Updated hero H1**:


**Updated hero H2**:


---

## STEP 7: Expand from MVP to Full Positioning

Once your MVP positioning resonates with target customers, expand it:

### Expand WHO

**Current**: Who you're targeting now

**Expand to**: Adjacent segments or broader audience


**When to expand**: After proving product-market fit with initial segment

---

### Expand WHAT

**Current**: Primary category or use case

**Expand to**: Additional use cases or categories


**When to expand**: After establishing primary positioning

---

### Expand DIFFERENT

**Current**: Primary differentiation

**Expand to**: Additional differentiators (2-3 total)


**When to expand**: When you need to defend against competitive responses

---

### Expand WHY

**Current**: Primary benefit

**Expand to**: Multiple benefits for different personas


**When to expand**: When selling to multiple stakeholders in buying committee

---

## MVP POSITIONING CHECKLIST

Before finalizing, ensure your MVP positioning:

**Clarity**:
- [ ] Can be understood in 5 seconds
- [ ] Uses language customers use (not internal jargon)
- [ ] Avoids vague terms ("innovative," "powerful," "easy")

**Specificity**:
- [ ] Target customer is specific enough to narrow messaging
- [ ] Product category/use case is clear
- [ ] Differentiation is concrete, not subjective

**Differentiaton**:
- [ ] Not something every competitor could claim
- [ ] Ideally binary (you have it, they don't)
- [ ] Matters to target customers

**Testability**:
- [ ] Can be tested with real prospects in conversations
- [ ] Can be measured (do people understand? do they care?)
- [ ] Can be iterated based on feedback

**Actionability**:
- [ ] Specific enough to write homepage copy
- [ ] Specific enough to guide feature prioritization
- [ ] Specific enough to inform go-to-market strategy

## COMMON MVP POSITIONING MISTAKES

### ❌ Waiting for Perfect Clarity

**Problem**: Spending months trying to perfect positioning before testing

**Fix**: Ship MVP positioning in 1-2 weeks, iterate based on real feedback

---

### ❌ Too Broad

**Problem**: "For anyone who wants to collaborate better"

**Fix**: Narrow to specific segment: "For design teams at tech companies"

---

### ❌ Too Vague

**Problem**: "The innovative solution for modern teams"

**Fix**: Be specific: "The real-time collaborative design tool"

---

### ❌ Positioning by Committee

**Problem**: Trying to please every internal stakeholder

**Fix**: Pick a clear direction, test with customers (not internally)

---

### ❌ Ignoring Feedback

**Problem**: Sticking with positioning that customers don't understand

**Fix**: Iterate quickly based on what resonates

- Create full messaging canvas
- Build complete homepage

**Month 3+: Optimize**
- Continuous iteration
- Expand to adjacent segments
- Deepen differentiation

---

## NEXT STEPS

Once you have validated MVP positioning:

1. **Fill out complete messaging canvas** → `messaging-canvas-template.md`
2. **Develop full value propositions** → `value-proposition-canvas.md`
3. **Build homepage structure** → `homepage-flow-template.md`
4. **Create hero section** → `hero-section-template.md`

**Remember**: MVP positioning is a starting point, not a final destination. Iterate continuously based on what you learn from customers.
