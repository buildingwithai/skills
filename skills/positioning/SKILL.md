# Product Positioning

Create clear, differentiated product positioning using proven frameworks.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Create positioning from scratch** - New product or feature launch
- **Reposition existing product** - Market has changed, need to refresh
- **Define market category** - Establish context for your product
- **Identify best-fit customers** - Who gets the most value?
- **Differentiate from alternatives** - What makes you different?
- **Competitive positioning** - Position against market leader, challengers, or nichers

**NOT for:**
- Creating messaging (use `messaging` skill after positioning is complete)
- Internal rollout (use `rollout-and-launch` skill)
- Go-to-market execution (use `gtm-strategy` skill)

## Prerequisites

**None** - Positioning is the foundation. Start here before messaging.

## The Positioning Process

Positioning answers five key questions:

1. **Who is this for?** (Best-fit customers)
2. **What alternatives exist?** (Competitive landscape)
3. **What makes us different?** (Unique capabilities)
4. **What value do we deliver?** (Differentiated benefits)
5. **What market are we in?** (Category context)

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks for positioning workshop and refinement

## How to Navigate This Skill

### Core Process (Start Here)

**1. `references/core/01-positioning-foundation.md`**
   - April Dunford's 5-component framework
   - 10-step positioning process
   - When to do positioning vs messaging
   - Timeline: 1 week for positioning workshop

### Advanced Topics (Load as Needed)

- **For competitive positioning:** See `competitive-intelligence` skill
- **For workshop facilitation:** See `messaging` skill references/core/10-workshop-facilitation-master-guide.md

## Quick Decision Trees

**Creating positioning from scratch:**
→ Read: core/01-positioning-foundation.md
→ Use: assets/positioning-canvas-template.md
→ Timeline: 1-2 weeks

**Repositioning existing product:**
→ Read: core/01-positioning-foundation.md
→ Focus on: "When to reposition" section
→ Use: assets/positioning-canvas-template.md

**Competitive positioning:**
→ Read: core/01-positioning-foundation.md (competitive alternatives section)
→ Also use: `competitive-intelligence` skill for detailed competitive analysis

## Key Principles

### 1. Positioning Comes Before Messaging

**Positioning = Context-setting**
- WHO is this for?
- WHAT alternatives exist?
- WHY are we different?

**Messaging = Translation** (comes after positioning)
- How do we communicate that positioning?

You can't write effective messaging without clear positioning.

### 2. Positioning is Relative

Positioning only makes sense in relation to alternatives:
- What would customers do if you didn't exist?
- How do you compare to those alternatives?
- What makes you uniquely valuable?

### 3. Best-Fit Customers, Not Everyone

Trying to position for everyone = positioning for no one

Focus on:
- Who gets the MOST value?
- Who is willing to pay?
- Who can you realistically serve?

### 4. Category Matters

Market category sets context for your value:
- Wrong category = value isn't obvious
- Right category = prospects understand immediately
- Sometimes = create new category

## Related Skills

**Next steps after positioning:**
- **`messaging`** - Create messaging based on your positioning
- **`rollout-and-launch`** - Roll out positioning internally and launch

**Complementary skills:**
- **`competitive-intelligence`** - Deep competitive analysis
- **`gtm-strategy`** - Full go-to-market orchestration
- **`pricing-packaging`** - Pricing strategy based on positioning

**Advanced topics:**
- **Category creation** - See `gtm-strategy` skill
- **Competitive trap-setting** - See `competitive-intelligence` skill

## Outputs from This Skill

When you complete positioning, you'll have:

✅ **Completed positioning canvas** with all 5 components
✅ **Best-fit customer profile** clearly defined
✅ **Competitive alternatives** mapped
✅ **Unique value** articulated
✅ **Market category** determined

**Next:** Use these outputs as input for the `messaging` skill.

## Typical Timeline

| Activity | Duration | Can Compress? |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Positioning workshop (initial) | 3-5 sessions over 1 week | ⚠️ Not recommended |
| Positioning refinement | 3-5 days | ✓ Yes, to 1-2 days |
| Customer validation | 1 week | ✓ Yes, if urgent |
| **Total** | **1-2 weeks** | **Can compress to 1 week** |

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Skipping positioning** → Jumping straight to messaging leads to generic, undifferentiated content
2. **Positioning for everyone** → Trying to appeal to all audiences dilutes focus
3. **Feature-focused positioning** → Leads with features instead of value
4. **Ignoring alternatives** → Positioning only works relative to what exists
5. **Wrong category** → Makes your value hard to understand

## Getting Started

**New to positioning?**
1. Read core/01-positioning-foundation.md
2. Complete positioning canvas template
3. Run positioning workshop with stakeholders
4. Validate with customers
5. Move to `messaging` skill
