# Competitive Alternatives Analysis

The foundation of effective positioning is understanding what customers actually compare you to — not who you think your competitors are.

## Overview

**The most critical insight in positioning**: Your competitive alternatives are NOT just your direct competitors. They include everything customers consider when solving the problem you solve:

- **Status quo** - Doing nothing, living with the problem
- **DIY solutions** - Spreadsheets, manual processes, homegrown tools
- **Indirect competitors** - Solutions in adjacent categories
- **Direct competitors** - Companies who look like you

**Why this matters**: If you position against the wrong alternatives, your differentiation will be meaningless to customers.

## The Competitive Alternatives Framework

### What Are Competitive Alternatives?

April Dunford's definition: **"What would customers do if your solution didn't exist?"**

This question reveals true alternatives, not aspirational competitors.

**Example: Slack**

**Wrong answer**: "Our competitors are Microsoft Teams and Zoom"

**Right answer**: "Our competitive alternatives are:
- Email (most common alternative customers replace)
- Status quo (scattered communication across multiple tools)
- DIY solutions (combination of email + chat + file sharing)
- Direct competitors (Teams, Discord for certain use cases)"

**The insight**: Slack's differentiation isn't "better than Teams" — it's "replaces email chaos." Positioning against email (the real alternative) is far more compelling.

---

## Why Most Companies Get This Wrong

### Common Mistake #1: Only Looking at Direct Competitors

**What companies do**: Research competitors who look like them (same category, same features)

**Why it fails**: Customers don't always compare you to those companies

**Example (from research)**:
- **Databook** initially positioned against "sales intelligence tools"
- But customers weren't comparing them to sales intelligence
- Real alternative: **Spreadsheets + manual relationship tracking**
- Solution: Created new category (SRM - Strategic Relationship Management)
- **Result**: 67% conversion increase, 10x lead growth

**Lesson**: Your real competition might be low-tech solutions, not the fancy competitors you admire.

---

### Common Mistake #2: Aspirational Competitors

**What companies do**: Position against market leaders they want to compete with

**Why it fails**: Customers don't see you as comparable yet

**Example**:
- Early-stage project management tool positions against **Asana**
- But customers compare them to: **Trello, spreadsheets, email threads**
- Positioning against Asana makes them seem presumptuous
- Positioning against spreadsheets/email makes differentiation clear

**Lesson**: Position against what customers **actually** use today, not what you want to replace eventually.

---

### Common Mistake #3: Ignoring "Do Nothing"

**The status quo is your biggest competitor**

Many customers choose to:
- Live with the problem
- Use workarounds
- Delay decision

**Why customers choose "do nothing"**:
- Change is risky
- Current solution is "good enough"
- Budget/resource constraints
- Political barriers

**Your positioning must address**: Why now? Why not wait? What's the cost of inaction?

**Example: Dropbox (early days)**

**Alternative analyzed**: Sending files via email attachments, USB drives, FTP servers

**Positioning**: "Your files, anywhere" - making file sharing effortless vs cumbersome alternatives

**Key differentiation**: Automatic syncing (eliminated manual file management)

---

## How to Identify Competitive Alternatives

### Method 1: Customer Interviews (Most Reliable)

**Questions to ask**:

1. **"What did you use before us?"**
   - Reveals actual alternatives customers replaced

2. **"What would you do if we went away tomorrow?"**
   - Shows backup options they still consider

3. **"What other solutions did you evaluate?"**
   - Captures alternatives in buying process

4. **"How did you solve this problem before?"**
   - Uncovers DIY and manual solutions

5. **"What almost prevented you from buying?"**
   - Reveals status quo bias and real objections

**Interview 10-20 recent customers** (mix of new and churned if possible)

**What to listen for**:
- Patterns (if 8/10 mention spreadsheets, that's a key alternative)
- Unexpected alternatives (often most valuable insights)
- Language they use (becomes your messaging)

---

### Method 2: Win/Loss Analysis

**Analyze deals you won AND lost**:

**For wins**: What did you beat?
- Direct competitors?
- Internal DIY solution?
- Status quo?

**For losses**: What did you lose to?
- Competitor (which one)?
- "Do nothing" decision?
- Budget/timing?

**Pattern analysis**:
- If you consistently lose to status quo → positioning must create urgency
- If you lose to DIY → positioning must show unfeasible complexity of building
- If you lose to specific competitor → positioning must differentiate clearly

**Tools**:
- Gong/Chorus call analysis
- Sales CRM win/loss notes
- Post-deal customer interviews

---

### Method 3: Sales Call Analysis

**Listen to recorded sales calls** (if you have them):

**What to extract**:
1. **Unprompted comparisons** - "We're currently using X..."
2. **Objections** - Often reveal alternatives ("We can build this ourselves")
3. **Questions about features** - Shows what matters vs alternatives
4. **Pricing anchors** - What they compare your price to

**Listen for phrases**:
- "We've been using..."
- "We looked at..."
- "Our team currently..."
- "We tried..."
- "We could just..."

---

### Method 4: Market Research (Supplementary)

**Analyst reports** (Gartner, Forrester):
- Magic Quadrants show direct competitors
- But remember: customers don't always buy from leaders

**Review sites** (G2, Capterra):
- See what customers compare you to
- Read "Alternatives Considered" data
- Note: Skewed toward direct competitors, misses DIY/status quo

**Competitor analysis** (useful but limited):
- Understand direct competitors' positioning
- Identify feature gaps
- But don't let this drive your positioning

---

## Mapping Competitive Alternatives

### The Alternatives Map

Create a visual map of ALL alternatives customers consider:

```
[Your Solution]
    ↓ vs
├─ Status Quo (do nothing)
├─ DIY Solutions (build in-house)
├─ Manual/Low-Tech (spreadsheets, email)
├─ Indirect Competitors (adjacent category)
└─ Direct Competitors (same category)
```

**Example: Early Dropbox**

```
Dropbox
    ↓ vs
├─ Status Quo: Email attachments + USB drives + manual syncing
├─ DIY: Company file servers, FTP setups
├─ Low-Tech: Emailing files to yourself, carrying laptops
├─ Indirect: Cloud backup services (Carbonite, Mozy) - backup not sharing
└─ Direct: Box (enterprise), SugarSync (consumer)
```

**Insight**: Dropbox's real competition was *manual file management*, not Box. Positioning focused on eliminating manual work, not enterprise features.

---

### Feature Comparison Matrix

**For each alternative, map**:

| Alternative | What They Have | What They DON'T Have | Why Customers Use It |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Status Quo** | Zero cost, zero change | Your core value | Inertia, risk aversion |
| **DIY** | Customization, control | Your ease/speed | Engineering resources |
| **Manual/Low-Tech** | Familiar, simple | Your automation | "Good enough" mindset |
| **Indirect Competitors** | Some capabilities | Your unique features | Different use case |
| **Direct Competitors** | Similar features | Your differentiators | Price, brand, features |

**This matrix reveals**:
1. **What you're REALLY competing against** (often not features)
2. **Your unique value** (what NO alternative has)
3. **Why customers resist** (status quo bias)

---

### Value Comparison (Not Just Features)

**Go deeper than features** - compare value delivered:

**Example: Project Management Tool**

| Alternative | Value Delivered | Limitations |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Email threads** | Free, everyone has it | No visibility, things get lost |
| **Spreadsheets** | Flexible, familiar | Manual updates, no automation |
| **Trello** | Visual, simple | Lacks advanced features |
| **Asana** | Comprehensive | Complex, expensive |
| **[Your Tool]** | **Simple + Powerful** | **New, unknown** |

**Your positioning emerges**: "Simple enough for small teams, powerful enough for complex projects" — bridges gap between Trello and Asana.

---

## From Alternatives to Differentiation

### The Differentiation Formula

1. **Identify the alternative** customers most commonly consider
2. **Find what that alternative lacks** that customers need
3. **Prove you have it** (your differentiated capability)
4. **Articulate the value** that capability delivers

**Example: Slack vs Email**

1. **Alternative**: Email for team communication
2. **What email lacks**: Real-time collaboration, organized by topic, searchable context
3. **What Slack has**: Channels, threaded conversations, integrations, search
4. **Value delivered**: "Communication happens in organized spaces, not chaotic inboxes"

**Positioning**: "Where work happens" (vs scattered across email/tools)

---

### Positioning Against Different Alternatives

**Your positioning changes** based on which alternative is most common:

**If most customers replace status quo**:
- **Focus on**: Why now? Cost of inaction, ease of getting started
- **Messaging**: Change is easy, risk is low
- **Example**: "Start in 5 minutes, no IT required"

**If most customers replace DIY**:
- **Focus on**: Cost/complexity of building, time to value
- **Messaging**: It's harder than it looks, we've solved edge cases
- **Example**: "What took us 3 years would take you 2 years to build"

**If most customers replace manual/low-tech**:
- **Focus on**: Time savings, error reduction, scale limitations
- **Messaging**: Works now, breaks at scale
- **Example**: "Spreadsheets break at 50 customers - we scale to 5,000"

**If most customers compare to direct competitors**:
- **Focus on**: Specific feature/capability gaps
- **Messaging**: What they can't do that matters
- **Example**: "Only tool with native X integration"

---

## Testing Your Alternatives Analysis

### Validation Checklist

**Test your competitive alternatives with customers**:

✅ **"Does this match reality?"**
   - Show your alternatives map to 5-10 customers
   - Ask: "What's missing? What's wrong?"

✅ **"Can sales articulate it?"**
   - Sales reps should be able to explain competitive alternatives in 30 seconds
   - If they can't, it's too complex

✅ **"Does it show up in sales calls?"**
   - Listen to 10 recent discovery calls
   - Do prospects mention these alternatives unprompted?

✅ **"Does win/loss data confirm?"**
   - Check: Do we lose to these alternatives?
   - If not, you might be missing something

---

### Common Red Flags

**🚩 Only direct competitors listed**
- Missing DIY, status quo, indirect
- Positioning will feel disconnected from customer reality

**🚩 Alternatives you want to compete with (not what customers compare)**
- Positioning will feel presumptuous
- Differentiation will miss the mark

**🚩 No "status quo" or "do nothing"**
- Missing biggest competitor
- Won't address inertia/risk

**🚩 Alternatives based on features only**
- Value-based alternatives are more accurate
- "What job are customers hiring this to do?"

---

## Updating Your Alternatives Over Time

### When to Revisit

**Quarterly review** of competitive alternatives:

1. **New competitors entered** market
2. **Customer behavior shifted** (e.g., pandemic made remote work tools mainstream)
3. **Your product evolved** (serving different use cases)
4. **Market matured** (DIY becomes harder, direct competition increases)

**Signals you need to update**:
- Win/loss patterns changed
- Sales objections shifted
- Customer interviews reveal new alternatives
- Market category evolved

---

### Market Maturity Impact

**Immature markets** (few direct competitors):
- **Alternatives**: Status quo, DIY, manual processes
- **Positioning focus**: Why solve this problem at all?
- **Example**: Early marketing automation (vs manual emails)

**Maturing markets** (some competitors):
- **Alternatives**: Mix of DIY and direct competitors
- **Positioning focus**: Why us vs building or basic tools?
- **Example**: Mid-stage project management (vs Trello/spreadsheets)

**Mature markets** (many competitors):
- **Alternatives**: Mostly direct competitors
- **Positioning focus**: Specific differentiation vs known alternatives
- **Example**: CRM space (vs Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)

**Your positioning must evolve** as market matures.

## Templates & Exercises

### Exercise 1: Customer Interview Script

**Use this script** with 10 recent customers:

```
Hi [Name], I'm doing research on how companies like yours evaluate solutions.
Would you have 15 minutes to help me understand your journey?

Questions:
1. Before [Your Product], how did you handle [problem]?
2. What prompted you to look for a solution?
3. What other options did you evaluate?
4. What almost made you choose something else?
5. If we disappeared tomorrow, what would you do?
6. How would you describe [Your Product] to a colleague?

Thank you! This helps us serve companies like yours better.
```

---

### Exercise 2: Alternatives Mapping Workshop

**Run this with your team** (Product, Sales, CS, PMM):

**Step 1** (5 min): Each person lists competitive alternatives individually

**Step 2** (10 min): Share lists, group similar alternatives

**Step 3** (15 min): For each alternative, answer:
- What % of customers consider this?
- What do they like about it?
- Why do they choose us instead?
- What do we have that it doesn't?

**Step 4** (10 min): Rank alternatives by:
- Frequency (how often customers compare)
- Importance (how much it matters to positioning)

**Output**: Prioritized list of top 3-5 competitive alternatives

---

### Exercise 3: Win/Loss Pattern Analysis

**Analyze last 20 deals** (10 wins, 10 losses):

| Deal | Won/Lost | Alternative They Chose | Why? | Pattern? |
|------|----------|----------------------|------|----------|
| Deal 1 | Won | vs Spreadsheets | Needed automation | DIY → Us (automation) |
| Deal 2 | Lost | vs Status Quo | Budget timing | Need urgency positioning |
| Deal 3 | Won | vs Competitor X | Needed feature Y | Direct comp (feature gap) |

**Look for patterns**:
- Most common alternative?
- Most common win/loss reason?
- Positioning gaps?

---

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Databook (2024 Case Study)

**Initial Positioning** (didn't work):
- **Category**: Sales intelligence tools
- **Alternatives**: ZoomInfo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator
- **Result**: Customers didn't understand differentiation

**Research Revealed**:
- **Real alternative**: Spreadsheets + manual account research
- **Customer job**: Strategic relationship management (not just intelligence)

**New Positioning**:
- **Category**: Strategic Relationship Management (SRM) - NEW category
- **Alternatives**: Manual relationship tracking, spreadsheets, CRM notes
- **Differentiation**: Purpose-built for strategic account relationships

**Results**:
- 67% website conversion increase
- 10x inbound lead growth
- Customers could clearly explain value (validated via Wynter testing)

**Lesson**: Wrong competitive set → ineffective positioning. Right competitive set (manual tools, not sales intelligence) → category creation opportunity.

---

### Example 2: Slack (Historical Analysis)

**Could have positioned against**:
- **Microsoft Teams** (wrong - didn't exist yet)
- **Chat tools** (Skype, Google Chat) - too narrow

**Actually positioned against**:
- **Email** (primary alternative)
- **Scattered communication** (email + chat + docs)

**Differentiation**:
- **vs Email**: Organized by topic (channels), not threads
- **vs Scattered tools**: All communication in one place

**Messaging**: "Where work happens" (vs scattered chaos)

**Why it worked**: Positioned against **customer pain** (email overload), not competitor features

---

### Example 3: Dropbox (Early Days)

**Could have positioned against**:
- **Enterprise file sharing** (Box) - wrong audience
- **Backup services** (Carbonite) - different job

**Actually positioned against**:
- **Email attachments** + **USB drives** (real behavior)
- **Manual file syncing** (actual pain)

**Differentiation**:
- **Automatic syncing** (vs manual)
- **Access anywhere** (vs device-specific)
- **Dead simple** (vs complex enterprise tools)

**Messaging**: "Your files, anywhere" (vs manual management)

**Why it worked**: Addressed **actual behavior** people wanted to replace (emailing files to themselves, carrying USBs)

---

## Common Questions

**Q: What if we have different alternatives for different customer segments?**

A: **That's normal.** Create alternative maps per segment:
- **SMB segment**: vs spreadsheets, DIY, basic tools
- **Enterprise segment**: vs internal builds, legacy enterprise tools
- **Mid-market**: vs mix of both

Your positioning should focus on **dominant segment** or create **segment-specific positioning**.

---

**Q: What if our real alternative is "do nothing" but that's not compelling positioning?**

A: **Create urgency.** Position against the **cost of doing nothing**:
- What breaks at scale?
- What's the opportunity cost?
- What's the risk of delay?

**Example**: "Spreadsheets work until you hit 100 customers - then you lose deals in chaos"

---

**Q: What if customers compare us to someone we're way better than?**

A: **Two scenarios**:

1. **They're right**: That IS your competitive set (position accordingly)
2. **They're wrong**: You haven't educated the market (positioning needs work)

**Test by asking**: "Why did you consider [that alternative]?"

If they have good reason, that's your competitive set. If they're misinformed, your positioning is unclear.

---

**Q: Should we position against market leaders even if customers don't compare us to them?**

A: **No.** Position against **actual alternatives** customers consider.

**Exception**: If you're trying to **move upmarket**, you might position against leaders to signal you belong in that tier - but only if you can credibly compete.

**Better approach**: Position against what customers use **today**, show path to graduating to leaders **later**.

---

**Q: How do we position if we're creating a new category (no direct alternatives)?**

A: **Every new category** has alternatives - they're just not in your category:

- Status quo (why change?)
- DIY (why not build?)
- Existing categories that partially solve the problem

**Example - Category Design**:
- **Databook created SRM category**
- **Alternatives**: CRM notes, spreadsheets, manual tracking
- **Positioning**: "First dedicated SRM platform" (vs makeshift solutions)

See `references/advanced/category-design-positioning.md` for full framework.

## Next Steps

**After completing competitive alternatives analysis**:

1. **Validate with customers** (10-20 interviews)
   → Confirm your alternative map matches reality

2. **Identify differentiation** (core file 04)
   → What do you have that alternatives don't?

3. **Define best-fit customers** (core file 03)
   → Who cares most about your differentiation vs alternatives?

4. **Develop positioning statement** (core file 05)
   → Articulate your position relative to alternatives

5. **Test positioning** (core file 06)
   → Validate with target audience using Wynter or internal methods

## Key Takeaways

1. **Competitive alternatives ≠ competitors** - Include status quo, DIY, indirect options
2. **Customer reality > your aspirations** - Position against what they compare, not who you want to compete with
3. **"Do nothing" is your biggest competitor** - Most customers choose status quo
4. **Interview customers** - Most reliable source of truth on alternatives
5. **Update quarterly** - Alternatives shift as market matures
6. **Different segments, different alternatives** - Map per customer type
7. **Alternatives drive differentiation** - What you position against determines what you emphasize

**Remember**: Positioning is relative. You can't position "in general" - only against specific alternatives. Get the alternatives right, and differentiation becomes obvious.
