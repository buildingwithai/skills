# 03: Provocative Hook Builder

**Use this when:** You've chosen a concept and need to script the actual content

**Time:** 30-60 minutes per script

**Output:** Complete video script with timestamps, ready to film

---

## Overview

The hook is EVERYTHING. 65% of people who watch the first 3 seconds will watch for 10+ seconds.

**The Provocative Hook Formula:**

Traditional: Problem → Solution → Result
**Provocative:** Controversial Statement → "Wait, what?" → Reveal

---

## The 3 Hook Rule

Every viral video needs THREE hooks working together:

### 1. Visual Hook (What They SEE)
- First frame must be interesting
- Movement, color, unexpected visual
- Pattern interrupt from scroll

**Examples:**
- ❌ Talking head in front of wall
- ✅ Tinder app with big red "X" over feature
- ✅ Person surrounded by 500 sticky notes (chaos)
- ✅ Dramatic zoom on feet (for foot app)

### 2. Text Hook (Words on Screen)
- 1-7 words MAX
- Supports visual
- Creates curiosity

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Check out my new app"
- ✅ "Tinder deleted this feature"
- ✅ "I make $100K doing what my teacher banned"
- ✅ "We fired our best customer"

### 3. Verbal Hook (What You SAY)
- First sentence creates intrigue
- Matches or expands text
- Voice tone matters (confident, shocked, casual)

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Hey guys, today I want to talk about..."
- ✅ "Tinder had this feature for 3 days. Then banned it."
- ✅ "My Spanish teacher said this was 'bad Spanish.' Now I make $100K with it."
- ✅ "Slack is making you dumber. Here's why."

- Make them want to know more

**Second 2-3: COMMIT THEM**

## Pattern Interrupts: Keep Attention Every 3-5 Seconds

After the hook, you need pattern interrupts to prevent drop-off:

**Timing Pattern:**
```
0-3 sec: HOOK
3 sec: Pattern Interrupt #1
7 sec: Pattern Interrupt #2
12 sec: Pattern Interrupt #3
17 sec: Pattern Interrupt #4
22 sec: Pattern Interrupt #5
27-30 sec: PAYOFF
```

### Pattern Interrupt Types:

**1. Visual Cuts**
- Change camera angle
- Switch to B-roll
- Zoom in dramatically

**2. Text Pop-Ups**
- Bold word emphasizes point
- Stat appears on screen
- Emoji reaction

**3. Sound Effects**
- Record scratch
- Ding/bell
- Unexpected music change

**4. Character Switches** (If using skit format)
- Cut to different character
- Character reaction shot
- Unexpected character entrance (Connor's "weird brother")

**5. Reveal/Surprise**
- Show unexpected visual
- Counter-argument setup
- Plot twist

**Example (B2B SaaS - "We Fired Our Best Customer"):**
```
0-3 sec: HOOK - "We fired our best customer. Here's why."
3 sec: Pattern Interrupt - Cut to screenshot of customer email
7 sec: Pattern Interrupt - Text pop-up "They paid $50K/year"
12 sec: Pattern Interrupt - Cut to team discussion footage
17 sec: Pattern Interrupt - Reveal why (they were toxic)
22 sec: Pattern Interrupt - Show company culture improvement
27-30 sec: PAYOFF - "Best decision we ever made"
```

## Character Development (If Using Skit Format)
