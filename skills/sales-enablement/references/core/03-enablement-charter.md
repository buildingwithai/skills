# Sales Enablement Charter

Complete guide to creating a sales enablement charter that aligns stakeholders, defines scope, and establishes your strategic foundation.

## Overview

A sales enablement charter is your strategic blueprint - it transforms random enablement efforts into a cohesive, value-adding function. It's the formal document that defines your mission, scope, stakeholders, governance, and roadmap.

**Why a Charter Matters**:
- Aligns leadership on enablement's role and priorities
- Sets clear expectations for deliverables and outcomes
- Establishes accountability and governance
- Prevents scope creep and "order-taking" mentality
- Provides strategic direction for team and investments

**Without a Charter**: Enablement becomes reactive, fragmented, and seen as "training department" rather than strategic revenue driver.

## Charter Components

A comprehensive enablement charter includes 10 essential components:

### 1. Executive Summary

**Purpose**: One-page overview that executives can read in 5 minutes

**Include**:
- Why enablement matters (business case summary)
- Current state and gaps
- Proposed approach and outcomes
- Investment required
- Expected ROI

**Example**:
"Sales enablement will reduce AE ramp time from 6 months to 3.5 months, improve win rates from 25% to 35%, and drive $2.8M in incremental revenue in Year 1 with a $750K investment (3.7x ROI). This charter outlines the mission, scope, team structure, and roadmap to achieve these outcomes."

---

### 2. Mission and Vision

**Mission Statement**: Why enablement exists and what it does

**Template**:
"The mission of Sales Enablement is to [core purpose] by [how] so that [business outcome]."

**Examples**:

**Example 1 (Growth-Stage SaaS)**:
"The mission of Sales Enablement is to accelerate revenue growth by equipping sales teams with the skills, content, and tools to execute efficiently and win consistently."

**Example 2 (Enterprise)**:
"The mission of Sales Enablement is to drive predictable revenue achievement by enabling world-class sales execution through continuous learning, strategic content, and data-driven optimization."

**Example 3 (Transformation)**:
"The mission of Sales Enablement is to transform our sales organization from product-focused to value-focused by implementing modern sales methodologies, consultative skills, and customer-centric content."

**Vision Statement**: Aspirational future state (3-5 years)

**Examples**:
- "To be recognized as a world-class enablement organization that drives measurable business impact and competitive advantage."
- "To create a culture of continuous learning where every seller has the knowledge, skills, and tools to be in the top quartile of our industry."
- "To evolve from sales enablement to revenue enablement, supporting the entire customer lifecycle from prospect to expansion."

---

### 3. Strategic Objectives

**What enablement will achieve** (aligned to company priorities)

**Format**: 3-5 strategic objectives, each with measurable outcomes

**Framework**: Use OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) or SMART goals

**Example Strategic Objectives**:

**Objective 1: Accelerate New Hire Productivity**
- Reduce AE ramp time from 6 months to 3.5 months
- Achieve 90%+ onboarding completion rates
- New hires reach 75% of quota by month 4 (vs month 7 currently)

**Objective 2: Improve Sales Execution and Win Rates**
- Implement MEDDIC methodology with 85%+ adoption
- Increase win rate from 25% to 32% (7 percentage points)
- Reduce sales cycle length by 15% (from 120 days to 102 days)

**Objective 3: Optimize Content and Knowledge Management**
- Centralize all sales content in single platform
- Achieve 80%+ content utilization (vs 40% currently)
- Reduce time searching for content from 3 hours/week to 30 minutes/week

**Objective 4: Enable Data-Driven Decision Making**
- Establish KPI dashboard with real-time visibility
- Prove 3:1 ROI on enablement investments
- Identify and scale top performer behaviors using conversation intelligence

**Objective 5: Drive Cross-Functional Alignment**
- Establish SLAs with marketing on content and campaign enablement
- Implement joint planning process with product for launches
- Create feedback loop from sales to product (monthly)

**Alignment Check**: Each objective should connect to a company-wide goal (revenue target, customer acquisition, retention, etc.)

### Priority Decision Framework

2. **Urgency**: What has external deadline or critical timing?
3. **Feasibility**: What can we execute well with current resources?
4. **Strategic Alignment**: What supports company-wide priorities?
5. **Stakeholder Need**: What do sales leaders and reps need most?

**Prioritization Matrix**:

| Initiative | Impact | Effort | Priority | Timeline |
|------------|--------|--------|----------|----------|

| CS enablement | Medium | High | P3 | Q4 |

**P0** = Must have, immediate priority
**P1** = Should have, next quarter
**P2** = Nice to have, when capacity allows
**P3** = Future consideration

- Draft all 10 components

**Output**: Draft charter document (10-15 pages)

---

### Step 2: Stakeholder Review (Week 2)

**Who**: CRO, VP Sales, key managers, marketing, product, ops

**Activities**:
- 1:1 reviews with each stakeholder
- Gather feedback and concerns
- Refine based on input
- Build consensus on scope and priorities

**Output**: Revised charter incorporating feedback

---

### Step 3: Present and Approve (Week 3)

**Who**: Executive leadership team

**Format**: 30-45 minute presentation
- Executive summary (5 min)
- Mission, objectives, scope (10 min)
- Roadmap and priorities (10 min)
- Metrics and ROI (5 min)

---

## Common Charter Mistakes

### 1. Too Vague or Generic

**Problem**: Charter reads like it could apply to any company

**Solution**: Be specific with metrics, timelines, and current state examples

**Bad**: "Improve sales performance"
**Good**: "Reduce AE ramp time from 6 months to 3.5 months, improving time-to-first-sale by 35%"

---

### 2. Scope Creep / Everything to Everyone

**Problem**: Enablement owns or supports too many things

**Solution**: Be clear about what's in scope, what's collaborative, and what's explicitly out of scope

**Use RACI**: Makes ownership crystal clear

---

### 3. No Measurable Objectives

**Problem**: Objectives are aspirational but not measurable

**Solution**: Every objective needs specific, quantifiable success criteria

**Bad**: "Create great content"
**Good**: "80% content utilization rate, measured monthly via platform analytics"

---

### 4. Created in Isolation

**Problem**: Enablement leader writes charter without stakeholder input

**Solution**: Involve stakeholders early, incorporate feedback, build consensus

**Result**: Higher buy-in and alignment

---

### 5. Set It and Forget It

**Problem**: Charter written once and never revisited

**Solution**: Quarterly reviews, annual refresh, updates as business evolves

---

## Charter Templates and Examples

### One-Page Charter Summary

**For**: Broad distribution, quick reference

**Include**:
- Mission (1 sentence)
- Top 3 objectives with targets
- In scope / out of scope (bullet points)
- Key stakeholders
- How to engage (contact info, office hours, platforms)

**Use**: Sales kickoffs, new hire onboarding, cross-functional meetings

---

### Detailed Charter Document

**For**: Leadership review, strategic reference

**Include**: All 10 components from this guide (10-15 pages)

**Use**: Executive approvals, quarterly reviews, strategic planning

---

### Roadmap Visual

**For**: Stakeholder communication, progress tracking

**Format**: Timeline or Gantt chart showing quarters and key milestones

**Use**: Town halls, business reviews, team planning

---

## Next Steps After Charter Approval

1. **Build your team** → See `04-team-structure-roles.md`
2. **Execute quick wins** → Deliver value in first 90 days
3. **Implement programs** → Follow roadmap from charter
4. **Measure and report** → Track KPIs, prove ROI
5. **Iterate and improve** → Use data to optimize

---

**Remember**: Your charter is your strategic north star. When you're asked to do something off-roadmap, refer to the charter. When stakeholders want to shift priorities, evaluate against charter objectives. When proving ROI, show progress against charter goals.

A strong charter elevates enablement from order-taking to strategic partner.
