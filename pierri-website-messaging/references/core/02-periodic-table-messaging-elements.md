## What is the Periodic Table of Messaging Elements?

The Periodic Table is Anthony Pierri's **comprehensive framework for all foundational messaging elements** needed to run a successful go-to-market plan.

Think of it as the complete building blocks of your messaging—when combined properly, they create compelling value propositions, homepage copy, sales decks, and more.

**The framework includes 9 core elements** organized in a specific order:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MARKET CONTEXT                                              │
│  1. Company Type    2. Persona    3. Context                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CURRENT STATE (Before your product)                        │
│  4. Current Alternative    5. Problem(s)                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  YOUR PRODUCT (What changes)                                │
│  6. Capabilities    7. Features    8. Benefits              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  MARKET POSITIONING                                          │
│  9. Product Category                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## The 9 Messaging Elements

### 1. Company Type (Firmographics)

**Definition**: The firmographics of the type of company you want to reach.

**What to include**:
- Industry or vertical
- Company size (employees, revenue)
- Geography (if relevant)
- Business model (B2B, B2C, marketplace, etc.)
- Stage (startup, growth, enterprise)

**Examples**:
- "Series A to Series C B2B SaaS companies"
- "Mid-market construction firms ($10M-$100M revenue)"
- "E-commerce brands with $1M+ monthly GMV"
- "Enterprise tech companies (1,000+ employees)"

**Why it matters**: Defines your market scope and helps narrow your targeting.

**Too broad**:
- ❌ "Any company"
- ❌ "Innovative businesses"

**Good specificity**:
- ✅ "Venture-backed startups in fintech"
- ✅ "Multi-location retail chains"

---

### 2. Persona

**Definition**: The primary person your product helps or the primary buyer.

**What to include**:
- Job title or role
- Department
- Seniority level
- Primary responsibility

**Examples**:
- "VP of Sales at mid-market companies"
- "Product Designers at tech companies"
- "CFOs at PE-backed firms"
- "Marketing Ops managers"

**Two types of personas**:
- **User persona**: The person who uses your product day-to-day
- **Buyer persona**: The person who makes the purchase decision

**For B2B SaaS**: Often these are different people.
- User: Product Designer
- Buyer: VP of Design or CTO

**Homepage guidance**: Usually focus on the **user persona** (the champion), with sections for buyer personas later.

**Why it matters**: Determines the language, pain points, and value propositions you emphasize.

---

### 3. Context

**Definition**: Details about this persona's day-to-day role and responsibilities.

**What to include**:
- Daily tasks and workflows
- Tools they currently use
- Who they work with
- Pressures and constraints
- Success metrics

**Examples**:

**For Product Designers**:
- "Responsible for designing new features for web applications"
- "Collaborate with product managers and engineers daily"
- "Use Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD"
- "Pressured to ship designs quickly while maintaining quality"
- "Measured on delivery speed and design consistency"

**For VPs of Sales**:
- "Manage a team of 10-50 sales reps"
- "Responsible for hitting quarterly revenue targets"
- "Use Salesforce, Outreach, and Gong"
- "Spend time in pipeline reviews, coaching reps, and reporting to exec team"
- "Measured on quota attainment and win rate"

**Why it matters**: Helps you understand their world and speak their language. Use this context to craft relevant messaging.

**Template**:
- "As a [PERSONA], you [PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY]"
- "You work with [TEAMS/PEOPLE]"
- "You're measured on [METRICS]"
- "You spend your time [KEY ACTIVITIES]"

---

### 4. Current Alternative

**Definition**: What they are using today to solve the problem (or not solve it).

**Four types of alternatives**:

1. **Another product** (direct competitor)
   - "Jira for issue tracking"
   - "Mailchimp for email marketing"
   - "Excel for financial modeling"

2. **A manual process** (workflow/DIY)
   - "Tracking projects in spreadsheets"
   - "Managing customers with email and folders"
   - "Scheduling meetings via email back-and-forth"

3. **A service provider** (agency/consultant)
   - "Hiring a freelance designer"
   - "Using a recruiting agency"
   - "Outsourcing to a dev shop"

4. **No solution** (living with the pain)
   - "Not tracking metrics at all"
   - "Ignoring the problem"
   - "Accepting inefficiency"

**Why it matters**: Understanding the alternative helps you frame differentiation and articulate where your product fits in.

**Examples**:

**Figma's customer alternative**:
- "Sketch + Dropbox/Abstract for design file management"
- "Emailing design files back and forth"
- "Working in isolation, then presenting in meetings"

**Calendly's customer alternative**:
- "Email back-and-forth: 'Does Thursday at 2pm work?'"
- "Assistant manually managing calendar"
- "Phone calls to schedule"

**Loom's customer alternative**:
- "Synchronous meetings for every update"
- "Long email explanations with screenshots"
- "Slack messages that lack nuance"

**Template**: "Today, [PERSONA] uses [ALTERNATIVE] to [ACHIEVE GOAL]"

---

### 5. Problem(s)

**Definition**: What issues arise from that way of doing things (the current alternative).

**Problem types**:

1. **Capability gaps**: Alternative can't do something critical
   - "Can't collaborate in real-time on designs"
   - "Can't track who made which changes"
   - "No way to automate repetitive tasks"

2. **Inefficiencies**: Alternative is slow, manual, or wasteful
   - "Takes 10 emails to schedule one meeting"
   - "Spending hours copying data between systems"
   - "Designers waiting for feedback for days"

3. **Friction points**: Alternative creates frustration or errors
   - "Version control nightmare with files"
   - "Lost context in long email threads"
   - "Manual errors in spreadsheet formulas"

4. **Costs**: Alternative is expensive (time, money, or both)
   - "Paying $200/month per designer for licenses"
   - "Dev team spending 20% of time on manual deploys"
   - "Losing deals due to slow response times"

**How to articulate problems**:

✅ **Good** (specific and concrete):
- "Design files are scattered across Dropbox, making it hard to find the latest version"
- "Scheduling a single meeting takes 8+ emails on average"
- "Engineers can't see design specs, so they build the wrong thing"

❌ **Bad** (vague and generic):
- "Collaboration is hard"
- "Inefficient workflows"
- "Lack of visibility"

**Multiple problems**: Most alternatives have 3-5 key problems. List them all.

**Template**: "With [ALTERNATIVE], [PERSONA] struggles to [GOAL] because [SPECIFIC PROBLEM]"

**Example - Figma**:
1. **Version control chaos**: Files scattered across Dropbox, hard to find latest version
2. **No real-time collaboration**: Can't see what teammates are working on until they're done
3. **Slow feedback loops**: Designers share static screenshots, wait days for feedback
4. **Dev handoff friction**: Engineers can't inspect designs, build wrong specs
5. **Expensive licensing**: Paying $100+/month per designer for Sketch + plugins

---

### 6. Capabilities

**Definition**: New abilities unlocked by your product—what users can DO with it.

**Capabilities are the bridge between features and benefits.** This is the most important and most misunderstood element.

**Capabilities are NOT**:
- Features (technical aspects)
- Benefits (outcomes)

**Capabilities are**: The actions your customers can take with your product.

**Structure**: "[VERB] [NOUN]" - Action statements

**Examples**:

**Figma capabilities**:
- "Design in the same file simultaneously with teammates"
- "Comment directly on designs for instant feedback"
- "Share a link for anyone to view or edit"
- "Inspect design specs as a developer"
- "See version history and restore previous states"

**Calendly capabilities**:
- "Send a link that shows your availability"
- "Let people book time directly on your calendar"
- "Set scheduling rules and buffer times"
- "Automatically send calendar invites and reminders"

**Loom capabilities**:
- "Record your screen and camera simultaneously"
- "Share a video with just a link"
- "Add comments at specific timestamps"
- "See who watched your video and for how long"

**Why capabilities matter**: They answer "What can I DO with this?" - the most important question for buyers evaluating products.

**Capabilities vs Benefits**:
- **Capability**: "Comment directly on designs"
- **Benefit**: "Get feedback faster, ship products quicker"

**Capabilities vs Features**:
- **Feature**: "Real-time commenting system with @mentions"
- **Capability**: "Comment on designs and tag teammates for input"

**Template**: "[PERSONA] can now [ACTION] [OBJECT]"

---

### 7. Features

**Definition**: The technical aspects (behind the scenes or visible in UI/UX) that enable capabilities.

**Features are the HOW behind capabilities.**

**Feature types**:

1. **UI/UX features** (what users see and interact with)
   - "Drag-and-drop interface"
   - "Real-time cursor tracking"
   - "@mention notifications"

2. **Backend features** (technical infrastructure)
   - "Cloud-based storage"
   - "End-to-end encryption"
   - "Webhook integrations"

3. **Platform features** (ecosystem capabilities)
   - "Figma plugins"
   - "API access"
   - "Mobile app"

**How features connect to capabilities**:

Each capability is powered by one or more features.

**Example mapping - Figma**:

| Capability | Features (that enable it) |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| "Design simultaneously with teammates" | • Real-time multiplayer editing<br>• Cursor tracking<br>• Conflict resolution |
| "Comment directly on designs" | • In-canvas commenting<br>• @mentions<br>• Comment threading |
| "Inspect design specs" | • Developer handoff mode<br>• Auto-generated CSS<br>• Asset export |

**When to emphasize features**:
- When speaking to technical buyers
- When features are truly unique
- When the "how" is the differentiation

**When to de-emphasize features**:
- When speaking to business buyers
- When features are table stakes
- When capabilities tell a clearer story

**Pierri's take**: In B2B SaaS, don't hide features. Buyers want to understand HOW. But lead with capabilities, then dive into features.

---

### 8. Benefits

**Definition**: The state changes driven by your capabilities (an increase of something good or decrease of something bad).

**Benefits are the outcomes—what changes for the customer.**

**Benefit types**:

1. **Efficiency gains** (save time/money)
   - "Ship features 2x faster"
   - "Reduce meeting time by 50%"
   - "Save $10K/year on software costs"

2. **Quality improvements** (better results)
   - "Fewer bugs shipped to production"
   - "More consistent design system"
   - "Higher quality customer interactions"

3. **Risk reduction** (avoid bad outcomes)
   - "Never lose work due to version conflicts"
   - "Reduce security vulnerabilities by 80%"
   - "Avoid compliance penalties"

4. **Growth enablement** (achieve more)
   - "Close 30% more deals"
   - "Scale design team without slowdown"
   - "Enter new markets faster"

**How benefits connect to capabilities**:

Benefits are the RESULT of using capabilities.

**Example mapping - Figma**:

| Capability | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| "Design simultaneously with teammates" | "Ship features 2x faster by eliminating review cycles" |
| "Comment directly on designs" | "Reduce feedback time from days to minutes" |
| "Share with a link" | "Get stakeholder buy-in faster with easy sharing" |
| "Inspect design specs" | "Reduce dev bugs by 40% with accurate handoffs" |

**The capability → benefit connection is critical**: Benefits are meaningless without explaining the capability that drives them.

❌ **Bad** (benefit without capability):
- "Save time" (how?)
- "Increase revenue" (doing what?)
- "Work more efficiently" (with what new ability?)

✅ **Good** (capability → benefit):
- "Comment directly on designs → Get feedback in minutes, not days"
- "Send a link to book time → Stop wasting 8+ emails per meeting"
- "Record and share video messages → Cut meetings by 50%, stay async"

**Pierri's contrarian take**: Don't LEAD with benefits in B2B SaaS. Lead with capabilities, THEN explain the benefit.

Why? Generic benefits ("save time," "increase revenue") are meaningless and undifferentiated. Capabilities show HOW you deliver the benefit, which is what buyers care about.

---

### 9. Product Category

**Definition**: The market category your product belongs to (or the one you're defining).

**Purpose**: Provides context for buyers unfamiliar with your product.

**Category types**:

1. **Established category** (well-known product type)
   - "Project management software"
   - "CRM"
   - "Design tool"
   - "Issue tracker"

2. **Emerging category** (newer, less known)
   - "Product analytics platform"
   - "Revenue operations software"
   - "Design systems manager"

3. **Hybrid/descriptive category** (combination or description)
   - "Collaborative design platform"
   - "Async video messaging tool"
   - "All-in-one workspace"

**When to use established categories**:
- Buyers are actively searching for that category
- Clear competitors exist
- Category is well-understood

**When to avoid established categories**:
- Category has negative baggage
- You're truly creating something new
- Category is too broad to be meaningful

**Pierri's guidance**: Unless you have $100M+ to spend on category creation, use an established category and differentiate within it.

**Why?** Even Slack, Miro, and Airtable with massive budgets failed to get buyers to adopt their invented categories.

**Examples**:

✅ **Good category usage**:
- Figma: "Interface design tool" (clear, established)
- Linear: "Issue tracking tool" (known category)
- Calendly: (Avoids category, uses use case: "Scheduling automation")

❌ **Bad category usage** (invented, confusing):
- "Customer insight orchestration platform"
- "Collaborative visual workspace" (people say "whiteboard")
- "All-in-one operating system for work"

**Template**: "The [DIFFERENTIATION] [ESTABLISHED CATEGORY]"

## How to Fill Out Your Messaging Canvas

The Periodic Table is used by filling it out left-to-right, top-to-bottom, like a user story map.

### Step 1: Define Market Context (Columns 1-3)

Start by understanding who you're targeting:

1. **Company Type**: What companies are you going after?
2. **Persona**: Who is your primary user/buyer?
3. **Context**: What's their day-to-day reality?

**Example - A design tool**:
- **Company Type**: Series A-C tech startups
- **Persona**: Product Designers
- **Context**: Work on product UI/UX, collaborate with PMs and engineers daily, measured on shipping speed and design quality

### Step 2: Understand Current State (Columns 4-5)

Map out the "before" state:

4. **Current Alternative**: What do they use today?
5. **Problems**: What issues does that create?

**Example - Design tool**:
- **Current Alternative**: Sketch + Dropbox/Abstract for file management
- **Problems**:
  - Version control nightmare
  - Can't collaborate in real-time
  - Slow feedback loops (screenshots → email → wait)
  - Dev handoff requires manual specs

### Step 3: Define Your Product (Columns 6-8)

Articulate what changes with your product:

6. **Capabilities**: What can they now DO?
7. **Features**: What powers those capabilities?
8. **Benefits**: What outcomes do they achieve?

**Example - Design tool (Figma)**:

| Capabilities | Features | Benefits |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Design simultaneously with team | Real-time multiplayer editing | Ship features 2x faster |
| Comment directly on designs | In-canvas comments, @mentions | Feedback in minutes, not days |
| Share with a link | Cloud-based, link sharing | Instant stakeholder access |
| Inspect design specs | Developer mode, CSS export | 40% fewer dev bugs |

### Step 4: Anchor with Category (Column 9)

9. **Product Category**: How do you describe your product?

**Example - Design tool**:
- **Category**: "Collaborative interface design tool"

## Creating Linkages: The Secret to Compelling Messaging

The power of the Periodic Table comes from **linking elements together**:

### Linkage 1: Capabilities → Problems

**Each capability should directly address a problem with the alternative.**

**Structure**: "Unlike [ALTERNATIVE] where you [PROBLEM], now you can [CAPABILITY]"

**Example**:
- **Problem**: Version control nightmare with Dropbox
- **Capability**: See version history and restore previous states
- **Message**: "Unlike Dropbox where finding the right version is a nightmare, Figma keeps complete version history automatically"

### Linkage 2: Features → Capabilities

**Each feature should power a specific capability.**

**Structure**: "With [FEATURE], you can [CAPABILITY]"

**Example**:
- **Feature**: Real-time multiplayer editing
- **Capability**: Design simultaneously with your team
- **Message**: "With real-time multiplayer editing, your whole team can design in the same file simultaneously"

### Linkage 3: Capabilities → Benefits

**Each benefit should be the result of using a capability.**

**Structure**: "[CAPABILITY] so you can [BENEFIT]"

**Example**:
- **Capability**: Comment directly on designs
- **Benefit**: Get feedback faster, ship quicker
- **Message**: "Comment directly on designs so feedback happens in minutes, not days, and you ship features 2x faster"

### The Full Chain: Problem → Capability → Feature → Benefit

**The complete value proposition connects all four**:

**Structure**: "Unlike [ALTERNATIVE] where [PROBLEM], we let you [CAPABILITY] with [FEATURE], so you [BENEFIT]"

**Example - Figma**:
"Unlike Sketch + Dropbox where version control is a nightmare, Figma lets you see complete version history with automatic cloud saving, so you never lose work and can restore any previous state instantly."

**Breakdown**:
- **Alternative**: Sketch + Dropbox
- **Problem**: Version control nightmare
- **Capability**: See complete version history, restore states
- **Feature**: Automatic cloud saving, version tracking
- **Benefit**: Never lose work

## Using the Periodic Table for Homepage Messaging

Once you fill out the canvas, you can extract messaging for every section of your homepage:

### Hero Section (H1 + H2)

**H1 options**:
- Category + differentiation: "The collaborative design tool"
- Use case: "Design products together, in real-time"
- Capability-focused: "Design, collaborate, and build products faster"

**H2 options**:
- Target audience + problem: "For design teams tired of version control nightmares and slow feedback loops"
- Capability expansion: "Work on the same file simultaneously, get instant feedback, and hand off perfect specs to developers"
- Benefit: "Ship features 2x faster with real-time collaborative design"

### Problem Section

Pull from **Current Alternative + Problems**:

"If you're using Sketch + Dropbox, you know the pain:
- ❌ Version control nightmares
- ❌ No real-time collaboration
- ❌ Slow feedback loops with screenshots
- ❌ Manual dev handoff creates errors"

### Solution Section

Pull from **Capabilities**:

"Figma changes everything:
- ✅ Design simultaneously with your team
- ✅ Comment directly on designs for instant feedback
- ✅ Share with a link for easy access
- ✅ Hand off perfect specs automatically"

### Value Proposition Sections

**Value Prop 1: Real-time Collaboration**
- Capability: "Design simultaneously with unlimited teammates"
- Feature: "Real-time multiplayer editing with cursor tracking"
- Benefit: "Ship features 2x faster by eliminating review cycles"

**Value Prop 2: Instant Feedback**
- Capability: "Comment directly on designs and tag teammates"
- Feature: "In-canvas commenting with @mentions and threads"
- Benefit: "Get feedback in minutes instead of days"

**Value Prop 3: Developer Handoff**
- Capability: "Let developers inspect and extract design specs"
- Feature: "Developer mode with auto-generated CSS and assets"
- Benefit: "Reduce dev bugs by 40% with accurate handoffs"

## Common Mistakes When Filling Out the Canvas

### ❌ Mistake 1: Confusing Capabilities and Benefits

**Wrong**:
- Capability: "Save time" (this is a benefit)
- Capability: "Increase revenue" (this is a benefit)

**Right**:
- Capability: "Automate meeting scheduling" → Benefit: "Save 5 hours/week"
- Capability: "Track deal progress in real-time" → Benefit: "Close 30% more deals"

**Remember**: Capabilities are actions (verbs). Benefits are outcomes (state changes).

### ❌ Mistake 2: Making Problems Too Vague

**Wrong**:
- "Collaboration is hard"
- "Inefficient processes"
- "Lack of visibility"

**Right**:
- "Team members can't see what each other is working on, leading to duplicated work"
- "Manually copying data between 5 systems takes 10 hours per week"
- "Sales managers don't know which deals are at risk until it's too late"

**Remember**: Specific and concrete beats vague and abstract.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Listing Features Instead of Capabilities

**Wrong** (these are features, not capabilities):
- "Real-time sync"
- "Cloud-based"
- "API access"

**Right** (capabilities enabled by those features):
- "Access your files from anywhere on any device" (enabled by cloud-based)
- "Integrate with your existing tools" (enabled by API access)
- "See changes instantly across all users" (enabled by real-time sync)

**Remember**: Capabilities answer "What can I DO?" Features answer "How does it work?"

### ❌ Mistake 4: Forgetting to Link Elements

**Wrong** (disconnected elements):
- Capability: "Share files with a link"
- Benefit: "Close more deals"
- (No connection between them)

**Right** (linked elements):
- Capability: "Share interactive prototypes with a link"
- Benefit: "Get stakeholder buy-in faster, close deals 2x quicker"
- (Clear connection: easy sharing → faster buy-in → more closed deals)

**Remember**: Every benefit should trace back to a capability. Every capability should address a problem.
