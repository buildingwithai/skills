- First skill to deeply integrate professional AND personal prioritization
- Not just "product management frameworks" or "personal productivity" - both together

### 2. **Conversational Design**
- Responsive coach model (not just reference library)
- User shares context → Skill analyzes → Recommends frameworks with WHY
- Matches user's depth (professional ↔ personal ↔ deep personal)
- Opt-in follow-ups (not pushy accountability)

### 3. **Evidence-Based**
- 30+ web searches (2025 research)
- 100+ sources synthesized
- Academic research (Journal of Neuroscience 2025 on decision fatigue)
- Thought leaders (Cal Newport, David Allen, Greg McKeown, Tim Ferriss)
- Real frameworks (not invented - proven in use at Google, Intercom, Intel)

### 4. **Framework-Rich**
- 15+ distinct prioritization frameworks
- Clear guidance on when to use which
- Not one-size-fits-all - choose the right tool for the problem

### 5. **Actionable**
- 41 templates (ready-to-use tools)
- Step-by-step processes (not just theory)
- Real examples with numbers
- Scripts and conversation starters

### 6. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Core layer (values, goals, decisions) → Application layer (product, daily tasks) → Review layer
- Load only what you need
- Deep dive references available but not overwhelming
