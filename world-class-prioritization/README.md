# World-Class Prioritization Skill

Master prioritization across professional and personal contexts using research-backed frameworks and proven methodologies.

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive training on prioritization—from product feature decisions to life goal setting, from daily task management to strategic planning. It synthesizes insights from leading thinkers (Cal Newport, Greg McKeown, David Allen, Tim Ferriss), established frameworks (RICE, MoSCoW, GTD, OKRs), and cutting-edge research (2025 neuroscience on decision fatigue, chronotype optimization, energy management).

## What's Inside

## Quick Start

1. **Read** `SKILL.md` for complete overview and navigation guide
2. **Review** `CONTENT-OUTLINE.md` to understand depth of each reference
3. **Start** with the section that matches your biggest challenge:
   - Lost in daily chaos? → Start with Eisenhower Matrix + GTD
   - Product prioritization needed? → Start with RICE/MoSCoW
   - Overwhelmed with commitments? → Start with Values + Saying No
   - Poor work-life balance? → Start with Energy Management + Weekly Review

## Status: Ready for Development

**Current State:**
- ✅ Core research completed (20+ searches across professional and personal prioritization)
- ✅ Skill framework designed (SKILL.md with full structure)
- ✅ Content outline completed (CONTENT-OUTLINE.md with detailed breakdowns)
- ✅ Directory structure created
- ⏳ Reference files (to be developed)
- ⏳ Templates (to be created)

**Next Steps:**
1. Develop core reference files (14 files)
2. Develop advanced reference files (10 files)
3. Create templates (41 templates)
4. Add case studies and examples
5. Create visual diagrams where helpful

## Key Differentiators

Unlike generic productivity advice, this skill:
- **Integrates across contexts** (professional AND personal, not just one)
- **Evidence-based** (2025 research, not just opinions)
- **Framework-rich** (10+ prioritization frameworks with when to use each)
- **Actionable** (41 templates, not just theory)
- **Comprehensive** (covers the full lifecycle: values → goals → frameworks → execution → review)
- **Progressive disclosure** (load only what you need, when you need it)

## Philosophy

True prioritization isn't about doing more—it's about doing less, better. It's not about time management, it's about energy and focus management. It's not about squeezing more into your day, it's about eliminating what doesn't matter so you can excel at what does.

As Greg McKeown writes: "If you don't prioritize your life, someone else will."

This skill gives you the tools to prioritize your life—professionally and personally.
