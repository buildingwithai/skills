# Weekly Review Process

*"The Weekly Review is the critical success factor for GTD." — David Allen*

## Why Weekly Review Is Non-Negotiable

**The pattern:**
- Monday: You have clarity, start strong
- Tuesday: Still on track
- Wednesday: Things get messy
- Thursday: Overwhelmed, reactive mode
- Friday: Barely keeping head above water
- Weekend: Anxious about what you forgot

**Why this happens:** No weekly review = system decay

**With weekly review:**
- Mental clarity all week
- Confidence you're on top of everything
- Proactive (not reactive)
- Reduced anxiety

**The weekly review is your reset button.**

## What Weekly Review Accomplishes

**Three goals:**

**1. Get Clear** (empty all inboxes)
- Email → Inbox zero
- Physical inbox → Processed
- Notes/capture tool → Processed
- Downloads folder → Cleaned

**2. Get Current** (update your system)
- Calendar → Review past, preview future
- Projects → Each has next action?
- Next Actions → Completed items removed, new items added
- Waiting For → Follow-ups sent
- Someday/Maybe → Anything to activate?

**3. Get Creative** (big picture thinking)
- Reflect on wins and lessons
- Look ahead at upcoming commitments
- Adjust course if needed
- Brainstorm new ideas

**Result:** You start Monday with complete clarity and confidence.

## The Complete Weekly Review Process

**Time required:** 60-90 minutes

**When:** Friday afternoon (or Sunday evening if you prefer)

**Where:** Quiet space, no interruptions

**Tools needed:**
- Your GTD lists (Next Actions, Projects, etc.)
- Calendar
- Email
- Notebook (for reflection)

### Step 1: Get Ready (5 minutes)

**1. Gather loose materials**
- Papers on desk → Physical inbox
- Receipts in wallet → Physical inbox
- Business cards → Physical inbox

**2. Review notes/capture tool**
- Phone notes → Empty (process each)
- Notebook pages → Process
- Voice memos → Transcribe or process

**3. Empty your head**
- 2-minute mind sweep: What else is on your mind?
- Capture any lingering thoughts

### Step 2: Review & Process (30-40 minutes)

**Process Inboxes**

**Physical inbox:**
- File, trash, or action
- Goal: Empty inbox

**Email inbox:**
- Process to zero (or <10)
- See inbox zero process in `11-gtd-getting-things-done.md`
- Action items → Next Actions list
- Waiting items → Waiting For list

**Digital inboxes:**
- Downloads folder → File or trash
- Desktop files → Organize
- Slack saved messages → Process

**Review Lists**

**Calendar (past 2 weeks):**
- Review what happened
- Any action items from meetings? → Add to Next Actions
- Any follow-ups needed? → Add to Waiting For

**Calendar (next 2 weeks):**
- What's coming up?
- Any preparation needed?
- Example: Presentation next Thursday → Add "Prepare slides for Thursday presentation" to Next Actions

**Next Actions list:**
- Check off completed items (satisfying!)
- Delete irrelevant items
- Clarify vague items (make them more specific)
- Add context tags if missing

**Projects list:**
- For EACH project: What's the next action?
- If no next action defined → Define it now
- If project is complete → Archive it
- If project is stalled → Why? Create action to unstall

**Waiting For list:**
- Anything overdue? → Follow up
- Add to Next Actions: "Email John about overdue proposal"

**Someday/Maybe list:**
- Anything to activate this week?
- Anything no longer interesting? → Delete
- New ideas to add?

### Step 3: Reflect & Plan (15-20 minutes)

**Weekly Reflection Questions:**

**1. Wins this week**
> What did I accomplish? What went well?

- Write 3-5 wins
- Celebrate progress
- Example: "Shipped feature X", "Closed deal with Acme", "Had breakthrough on strategy"

**2. Challenges this week**
> What was difficult? What didn't go as planned?

- Identify obstacles
- Example: "Too many meetings", "Underestimated project timeline", "Got derailed by crisis"

**3. Lessons learned**
> What would I do differently next time?

- Extract insights
- Example: "Need to decline non-essential meetings", "Build in buffer time", "Need better crisis prioritization process"

**4. Energy audit**
> How was my energy this week? (1-10)

- If low: What drained me? How can I renew?
- If high: What energized me? How can I do more?
- See `09-energy-management-chronotypes.md`

**5. Priorities check**
> Did I spend time on what matters most?

- Review against goals/values (see `01-values-clarification-foundation.md`)
- Example: Goal = launch product. Did I spend time on that? Or get distracted by busywork?

**6. Time allocation**
> Where did my time actually go?

**Quick audit:**
- Deep work: ___ hours (Goal: 10-15 hours/week)
- Shallow work: ___ hours
- Meetings: ___ hours
- Q2 (Important/Not Urgent): ___ hours

**If misaligned:** Adjust next week

**7. Relationships**
> Who did I connect with? Who did I neglect?

- Any relationships needing attention?
- Add to Next Actions: "Schedule coffee with Sarah"

**Planning Next Week:**

**1. Review upcoming calendar**
- What meetings/commitments are coming?
- Any conflicts?
- Any preparation needed?

**2. Identify Most Important Projects**
- What 3-5 projects should move forward next week?
- For each: What's the next action?
- Block calendar time for these (time blocking)

**3. Set weekly intentions**
> What does success look like next week?

- Example: "Ship feature X, complete strategy doc, hire PM"
- Make it specific, measurable

**4. Capacity check**
> How much deep work time do I have next week?

- Count hours NOT in meetings
- Realistic deep work: 10-15 hours/week
- Don't overcommit

**5. Red flags**
> Any warning signs for next week?

- Too many meetings? → Decline some
- Big deadline? → Block focus time
- Traveling? → Adjust expectations

### Step 4: Capture Creative Ideas (10-15 minutes)

**Now that your mind is clear, you have space for creativity.**

**Big picture thinking:**

**1. Goals progress**
> How am I tracking toward quarterly/annual goals?

- Review OKRs (see `02-goal-setting-frameworks.md`)
- On track? Behind? Ahead?
- Adjustments needed?

**2. Strategic thinking**
> What opportunities am I seeing?

- Industry trends?
- New ideas for projects?
- Process improvements?

**3. Learning & growth**
> What do I want to learn/improve?

- Skills to develop?
- Books to read?
- Courses to take?

**4. Relationships & networking**
> Who should I connect with?

- Mentors to reach out to?
- Colleagues to strengthen relationships?
- Customers to check in with?

**5. Personal life**
> What needs attention?

- Health/fitness goals?
- Family/friends?
- Hobbies/interests?

**Capture everything. Add to appropriate lists (Next Actions, Projects, Someday/Maybe).**

### Step 5: Wrap Up (5 minutes)

**1. Choose 3 MITs (Most Important Tasks) for Monday**
- These are your Monday priorities
- Write them down where you'll see them Monday morning

**2. Set up your workspace**
- Clean desk
- Close unnecessary tabs/apps
- Ready for Monday

**3. Shutdown ritual**
- Close all work apps
- Say "Shutdown complete" (see `08-time-blocking-deep-work.md`)
- You're done. Enjoy weekend guilt-free.

## Common Weekly Review Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Skipping It

**The trap:** "I'm too busy this week, I'll skip review"

**Result:** Next week is even more chaotic

**Fix:** Non-negotiable. Block 90 minutes on calendar. Treat it like a meeting with your CEO (yourself).

### Mistake 2: Rushing Through It

**The trap:** "I'll just process inboxes quickly, 15 minutes"

**Result:** Surface-level review, system isn't truly updated

**Fix:** Give it the full 60-90 minutes. Quality over speed.

### Mistake 3: Only Processing (No Reflecting)

**The trap:** Empty inboxes, update lists, done

**Result:** You're organized but not learning or improving

**Fix:** Reflection questions are essential. Don't skip Step 3.

### Mistake 4: Interruptions During Review

**The trap:** Doing review while Slack/email are open

**Result:** Get distracted, don't finish, defeats purpose

**Fix:** Close all distractions. Book conference room if needed. Friday afternoon when office is quiet.

### Mistake 5: No Action on Insights

**The trap:** "I should decline more meetings" (write it in journal, then forget)

**Result:** Same problems next week

**Fix:** Turn insights into actions
- Insight: "Too many meetings"
- Action: "Decline 3 meetings next week" → Add to Next Actions

## Integration with Other Frameworks

### Weekly Review + GTD

**GTD provides the structure:**
- Process inboxes
- Update lists
- Review projects

**Weekly Review adds:**
- Reflection (learning from the week)
- Strategic thinking (big picture)
- Goal alignment (are you on track?)

**See:** `11-gtd-getting-things-done.md`

### Weekly Review + OKRs

**Check-in on Objectives & Key Results:**
- What progress did I make on Key Results this week?
- Current completion: 0.0 (no progress) to 1.0 (complete)
- On track for 0.7 by quarter end?

**See:** `02-goal-setting-frameworks.md`

### Weekly Review + Eisenhower Matrix

**Time allocation audit:**
- Q1 (Urgent & Important): ___ hours
- Q2 (Not Urgent & Important): ___ hours ← Goal: 50%+
- Q3 (Urgent & Not Important): ___ hours ← Minimize
- Q4 (Not Urgent & Not Important): ___ hours ← Eliminate

**Action:** If too much Q3, identify what to delegate/decline next week

**See:** `10-eisenhower-matrix-daily-planning.md`

### Weekly Review + Deep Work

**Deep work audit:**
- Total deep work hours this week: ___
- Goal: 10-15 hours minimum

**If below 10 hours:**
- What got in the way? (meetings, interruptions, etc.)
- How can I protect more deep work time next week?
- Block deep work on calendar NOW for next week

**See:** `08-time-blocking-deep-work.md`

### Weekly Review + Energy Management

**Energy audit:**
- When was I most energized this week?
- When was I drained?

- Adjustments for next week?

**See:** `09-energy-management-chronotypes.md`

### Weekly Review + Pareto Principle (80/20)

**80/20 analysis:**
- What 20% of activities created 80% of results?
- Do more of those next week
- What 80% of activities created 20% of results?
- Minimize or eliminate those

**See:** `12-pareto-principle-8020-rule.md`

## Monthly & Quarterly Extensions

**Weekly review = tactical focus (this week, next week)**

**Monthly review = zoom out slightly (30 minutes extra)**

**In addition to weekly review, add:**
- Review monthly goals
- Review budget/spending
- Review Someday/Maybe list (anything to activate?)
- Plan next month's big rocks

- What were the biggest lessons?
- What should I start/stop/continue next quarter?
- Are my goals still the right goals?
- Am I living aligned with my values?

**See:** `14-quarterly-annual-planning.md`

## Building the Weekly Review Habit

**Week 1-4: Establishing the routine**

**Pick your time:**
- Friday 3-5pm (most common)
- Sunday evening (if you prefer)

**Block it on calendar:**
- Recurring weekly event
- "Weekly Review - DO NOT SCHEDULE OVER"

**Set a reminder:**
- 15 minutes before: "Time to start weekly review"

**Week 5-8: Refining the process**

**Track time:**
- How long does it actually take?
- What sections take longest?
- Can you streamline?

**Adjust checklist:**
- Add items specific to your role
- Remove items that don't add value

**Week 9-12: Making it stick**

**By now it should feel automatic:**
- Friday afternoon = weekly review
- You feel off if you skip it
- You notice the difference it makes

**Reward yourself:**
- After review: Coffee, walk, early weekend start
- Positive reinforcement

### Weekly Review Scorecard

**Track over time to see patterns:**

| Week | Deep Work Hours | Wins | Energy (1-10) | Review Done? |
|------|----------------|------|---------------|--------------|
| Mar 1 | 12 | 3 | 7 | ✓ |
| Mar 8 | 8 | 2 | 5 | ✓ |
| Mar 15 | 15 | 5 | 8 | ✓ |
| Mar 22 | 6 | 1 | 4 | ✗ (Skipped) |
| Mar 29 | 14 | 4 | 8 | ✓ |

**Insights:**
- Week of Mar 22: Skipped review → Low deep work, low energy, few wins
- Week of Mar 15: Did review → High deep work, high energy, many wins
- **Correlation is clear**

## The Power of Consistency

**Weekly review is a keystone habit:**

**What it enables:**
- Inbox zero (reduces anxiety)
- Project progress (each project moves forward)
- Goal alignment (stay on track)
- Learning (extract lessons weekly)
- Proactivity (plan ahead vs. react)
- Mental clarity (trust your system)

**Without weekly review:**
- System decays
- Tasks fall through cracks
- Reactive firefighting
- Anxiety increases
- Burnout risk

**The pattern:**
- Skip one week → Noticeable chaos
- Skip two weeks → System collapse
- Do it 12 weeks straight → Transformative

## Summary: Your Weekly Reset

**Key principles:**
1. **Non-negotiable** (block 90 minutes weekly)
2. **Three goals:** Get clear, get current, get creative
3. **Process + Reflect** (don't just update lists)
4. **Turn insights into actions** (make improvements)
5. **Plan next week** (start Monday with clarity)
6. **Consistency is everything** (do it even when you "don't have time")

**The weekly review is the difference between:**
- Chaos vs. clarity
- Reactive vs. proactive
- Overwhelm vs. calm confidence

**90 minutes a week = 52 reset buttons per year**
