# The Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)

*Roughly 80% of results come from 20% of efforts. The key to prioritization: Identify and double down on the vital 20%.*

## What is the Pareto Principle?

**The principle:** In many situations, roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes.

**Origin:** Vilfredo Pareto (1896) observed that 80% of land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population. The pattern appears everywhere.

**Examples:**
- 80% of sales from 20% of customers
- 80% of bugs from 20% of code
- 80% of usage from 20% of features
- 80% of results from 20% of work
- 80% of complaints from 20% of customers
- 80% of revenue from 20% of products

**Not always exactly 80/20** (could be 90/10 or 70/30), but the principle holds: **Imbalance is universal.**

## Why It Matters for Prioritization

**Most people:** Spread effort evenly across all tasks (100% effort on 100% of activities)

**Pareto thinkers:** Focus 80% of effort on the vital 20% of activities

**The insight:** Not all tasks are equal. Some create disproportionate results.

**Your job:** Identify the 20% that creates 80% of value, then double down on it.

## Identifying Your Vital 20%

### Step 1: List All Activities
Write down everything you do (work tasks, meetings, projects, etc.)

### Step 2: Measure Impact
For each activity, estimate: How much does this contribute to my goals/results?

**Metrics depend on context:**
- **Work:** Revenue generated, users impacted, OKRs moved
- **Personal:** Fulfillment, health, relationships strengthened

### Step 3: Rank by Impact
Sort activities from highest to lowest impact.

### Step 4: Calculate Cumulative Percentage
- Top 20% of activities create what % of total impact?
- Usually around 80%

### Step 5: Identify the Vital Few
The top 20% are your "vital few."

### Step 6: Double Down
- Spend 80% of time/energy on the vital 20%
- Minimize, delegate, or eliminate the "trivial 80%"

## Examples Across Domains

### Product Management
**80% of user engagement from 20% of features**

**Implication:** Focus on improving the core 20%, not building more features.

**Example:** Instagram focused on photo filters (vital 20%) vs. trying to compete on all social features.

### Sales
**80% of revenue from 20% of customers**

**Implication:** Double down on serving your top 20% of customers. Fire bottom 20% if they're draining resources.

**Example:** SaaS company realized 80% of revenue from enterprise customers (20% of total). Stopped serving SMBs, went all-in on enterprise.

### Tasks
**80% of your daily impact from 20% of your tasks**

**Implication:** Identify the 2-3 most important tasks daily. Do those first. Everything else is secondary.

**Example:** Of 10 tasks today, 2 tasks (launching product, closing deal) create 80% of value. Do those. The other 8 can wait or be delegated.

### Meetings
**80% of meeting value from 20% of meetings**

**Implication:** Decline most meetings. Protect time for the 20% that actually matter.

**Example:** 10 meetings/week. 2 meetings (1-on-1 with direct reports, weekly planning) create 80% of value. The other 8 are status updates (low value).

### Learning
**80% of knowledge from 20% of reading**

**Implication:** Focus on highest-value books/articles. Skim the rest.

**Example:** Read 10 books. 2 books (Atomic Habits, Deep Work) changed your life. The other 8 were fine but forgettable.

## The 80/20 Analysis Process

**Step-by-step:**

**1. Choose a domain** (tasks, customers, features, meetings, etc.)

**2. List all items** (all tasks, all customers, etc.)

**3. Measure impact** (revenue, time saved, satisfaction, etc.)

**4. Rank by impact** (highest to lowest)

**5. Calculate cumulative %**
| Item | Impact | Cumulative % |
|------|--------|--------------|
| A | $50K | 50% |
| B | $20K | 70% |
| C | $10K | 80% |
| D | $10K | 90% |
| E | $10K | 100% |

**6. Identify top 20%** (Items A & B = 70-80% of total)

**7. Action:**
- **Top 20%:** Invest heavily
- **Middle 60%:** Maintain efficiently
- **Bottom 20%:** Minimize or eliminate

## Applying Pareto to Daily Tasks

**Morning exercise:** List all tasks for today.

**Of 10 tasks, which 2 will create 80% of your impact?**

**Circle those 2. Do them first. Everything else is secondary.**

**Example:**
Tasks today:
1. Launch new product (HIGH IMPACT) ✅ Vital 20%
2. Close $100K deal (HIGH IMPACT) ✅ Vital 20%
3. Status update email (low impact)
4. Slack responses (low impact)
5. Read industry news (low impact)
6. Meeting: weekly sync (medium impact)
7. Expense report (low impact)
8. Clean inbox (low impact)
9. Review analytics (medium impact)
10. Plan next week (medium impact)

**Prioritize:** Do #1 and #2 first (the vital 20%). If you do NOTHING else today, you've created 80% of your value.

**The rest:** Batch, delegate, or skip.

## Compounding 80/20

**Apply recursively:** 20% of your 20% = 4% that creates 64% of results.

**Example:**
- 20% of your tasks create 80% of value
- Of that 20%, focus on the top 20%
- = 4% of tasks create 64% of value

**Extreme focus on extreme winners.**

**Application:** Of your top 5 tasks this week, which 1 task is THE most important? Do that one first, with full focus.

## When 80/20 Doesn't Apply

**Not universal. Exceptions:**

**1. Baseline requirements**
Must do 100%, can't skip 80%. Examples: Compliance, payroll, taxes, legal obligations.

**2. Relationships**
Not transactional. Can't ignore 80% of your friends/family because they create "less value."

**3. Ethical issues**
Can't ignore 80% of customer complaints to focus on top 20%. Every customer deserves respect.

**Use judgment.**

## 80/20 for Time Management

**Insight:** 80% of your productivity comes from 20% of your hours.

**Which hours are most productive?**
- Morning? Afternoon? Evening?
- After exercise? After coffee?
- Deep work blocks? Collaboration time?

**Identify your peak 20% of hours. Protect them fiercely. Schedule your most important work during those hours.**

**Example:**
- Most productive: 9-11am (after coffee, before meetings)
- Least productive: 2-4pm (post-lunch dip)

**Action:** Schedule deep work 9-11am. Schedule meetings/email 2-4pm.

## 80/20 for Goals (5/25 Rule Connection)

**Warren Buffett's 5/25 Rule is an 80/20 application:**
- 25 goals → Top 5 are the vital 20%
- Focus on top 5, avoid the other 20 (the trivial 80%)

**See `02-goal-setting-frameworks.md` for full 5/25 process.**

## Summary: Focus on the Vital Few

**Key principles:**
1. **Not all efforts are equal** (some create disproportionate results)
2. **Identify the vital 20%** (tasks, features, customers, hours)
3. **Double down on the 20%** (invest heavily)
4. **Minimize the trivial 80%** (delegate, eliminate, or do last)
5. **Compound it** (20% of 20% = extreme focus)

**The power of 80/20: You can achieve more by doing less, if you focus on the right things.**
