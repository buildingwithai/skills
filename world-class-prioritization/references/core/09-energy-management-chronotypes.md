# Energy Management & Chronotypes

*"Manage your energy, not your time." — Tony Schwartz*

## The Problem: Working Against Your Biology

**Common productivity advice:**
> "Wake up at 5am! Be productive early! Morning people are successful!"

**Reality:** If you're naturally a night owl, forcing yourself to wake at 5am doesn't make you productive. It makes you miserable and ineffective.

**The insight:** Productivity isn't about time management. It's about **energy management**.

**You have ~16 waking hours. But you don't have 16 hours of equal energy.**

## Energy vs. Time

**Time management thinking:**
> "I have 8 hours of work today. Let me fill them with tasks."

**Energy management thinking:**
> "I have ~4 hours of peak energy today. Let me use those hours for my most important work. The other 4 hours are for low-energy tasks."

**The difference:**
- **Time management:** All hours are equal
- **Energy management:** Some hours are worth 3x others

**Prioritization through energy lens:**
1. Identify your high-energy hours (biological prime time)
2. Protect those hours for deep work (see `08-time-blocking-deep-work.md`)
3. Schedule low-energy tasks (email, admin) during low-energy hours
4. Renew energy throughout day

## The Four Chronotypes

**Dr. Michael Breus research:** People fall into 4 chronotypes based on their circadian rhythms.

**Your chronotype determines:**
- When you're most alert
- When you should do deep work
- When you should exercise
- When you should have difficult conversations

**You can't change your chronotype. But you can work WITH it instead of against it.**

### Chronotype 1: Lions (15-20% of population)

**Characteristics:**
- Early risers (wake naturally 5:30-6am)
- Peak energy: Morning (8am-12pm)
- Crash in afternoon
- Asleep by 10pm

**Ideal schedule:**
- **Deep work:** 8am-12pm (your superpower hours)
- **Meetings:** 10am-12pm (high energy)
- **Lunch:** 12pm
- **Administrative work:** 2-4pm (post-lunch dip)
- **Exercise:** Morning (6-7am)
- **Wind down:** 8pm

**Famous Lions:** Tim Cook (Apple), Michelle Obama, Richard Branson

**If you're a Lion:**
✅ Do your most important work before noon
✅ Schedule difficult conversations in morning
✅ Protect 8am-12pm fiercely (this is your gold mine)
❌ Don't schedule important work after 3pm (you're running on fumes)
❌ Don't fight your early bedtime (you need it to maintain morning energy)

### Chronotype 2: Bears (50% of population)

**Characteristics:**
- Wake naturally 7-8am
- Peak energy: Mid-morning to early afternoon (10am-2pm)
- Moderate energy evening
- Asleep by 11pm

**Ideal schedule:**
- **Deep work:** 10am-2pm (your peak)
- **Meetings:** 11am-1pm or 3-4pm
- **Lunch:** 12:30pm
- **Administrative work:** 9-10am or 4-5pm
- **Exercise:** Late morning or early evening
- **Wind down:** 10pm

**Famous Bears:** Most people (this is the most common chronotype)

**If you're a Bear:**
✅ Start work around 9am (no need for 5am wake-ups)
✅ Schedule deep work 10am-2pm
✅ You're flexible - can adapt to most schedules
❌ Don't book early morning meetings (you're still warming up)
❌ Don't expect peak performance at 8am (you're not a Lion)

### Chronotype 3: Wolves (15-20% of population)

**Characteristics:**
- Wake naturally 8-9am (or later)
- Peak energy: Late morning to evening (12pm-8pm)
- Two energy peaks: Noon-2pm and 5-9pm
- Asleep after midnight

**Ideal schedule:**
- **Deep work:** 12pm-2pm and 5-8pm (your two peaks)
- **Meetings:** 2-4pm
- **Lunch:** 1pm
- **Administrative work:** Morning (9-11am, while you warm up)
- **Exercise:** Evening (7-8pm)
- **Wind down:** 11pm

**Famous Wolves:** Barack Obama, Aaron Sorkin, J.R.R. Tolkien

**If you're a Wolf:**
✅ Embrace your evening peak (this is your advantage)
✅ Schedule creative work in evening when others are done
✅ Do admin work in morning (email, planning)
❌ Don't accept 8am meetings (you're useless)
❌ Don't feel guilty about sleeping in (you're wired differently)
❌ Don't force yourself into a Lion schedule (it will destroy your productivity)

**Career tip for Wolves:** Choose flexible work environments. Remote work is ideal.

### Chronotype 4: Dolphins (10% of population)

**Characteristics:**
- Light sleepers, insomnia-prone
- Wake naturally 6-7am (but not refreshed)
- Peak energy: Mid-morning to early evening (10am-6pm)
- Struggle to fall asleep
- Highly intelligent, perfectionistic

**Ideal schedule:**
- **Deep work:** 10am-12pm and 3-6pm
- **Meetings:** 11am-1pm or 3-4pm
- **Lunch:** 12pm
- **Administrative work:** Early morning or late afternoon
- **Exercise:** Morning (helps with sleep)
- **Wind down:** Start at 9pm (need longer wind-down)

**Famous Dolphins:** Many entrepreneurs, innovators (anxious perfectionists)

**If you're a Dolphin:**
✅ Prioritize sleep hygiene (see below)
✅ Schedule deep work mid-morning (avoid early morning)
✅ Build in buffer time (you need mental breaks)
✅ Exercise regularly (helps with sleep)
❌ Don't schedule back-to-back meetings (you need recovery time)
❌ Don't drink caffeine after 2pm (worsens sleep)
❌ Don't work late into night (even if you can't sleep, rest your brain)

## Discovering Your Chronotype

### Method 1: The Vacation Test

**When you're on vacation (no alarm clock):**
- What time do you naturally wake up?
- What time of day do you feel most energetic?
- What time do you naturally go to bed?

**Your vacation sleep pattern = your true chronotype**

### Method 2: The Energy Audit (One Week)

**Track for 7 days:**

| Time | Energy Level (1-10) | What I Was Doing |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| 7am | 4 | Just woke up |
| 8am | 5 | Getting ready |
| 9am | 6 | Starting work |
| 10am | 8 | Peak focus |
| 11am | 9 | Peak focus |
| 12pm | 8 | Still strong |
| 1pm | 5 | Post-lunch dip |
| 2pm | 4 | Lowest point |
| 3pm | 6 | Recovering |
| 4pm | 7 | Second wind |
| 5pm | 7 | Good energy |
| 6pm | 6 | Winding down |

**After one week:**
- Identify your peak energy hours (8-10 rating)
- Identify your lowest energy hours (1-5 rating)
- This is your **Biological Prime Time** (BPT)

### Method 3: Online Assessment

**Take the chronotype quiz:**
- Michael Breus: thepowerofwhenquiz.com
- Or search "chronotype quiz"

**15 questions, 5 minutes, gives you your type**

## Biological Prime Time (BPT)

**Biological Prime Time = Your 3-4 hours of peak cognitive energy each day**

**This is your most valuable time.** Protect it ruthlessly.

**How to identify your BPT:**

**Option 1:** Energy audit (Method 2 above)

**Option 2:** Reflect on past experiences
- When do you do your best work?
- When do you feel most creative?
- When can you focus most easily?
- That time = your BPT

**Common BPT patterns:**

**Lions:** 8am-12pm
**Bears:** 10am-2pm
**Wolves:** 12pm-2pm and 5-9pm (two peaks)
**Dolphins:** 10am-12pm and 3-6pm

## Matching Tasks to Energy Levels

**The strategy: High-energy tasks during high-energy hours. Low-energy tasks during low-energy hours.**

### High-Energy Hours (BPT)

**Schedule:**
- Deep work (strategic thinking, writing, analysis)
- Creative work (brainstorming, design, problem-solving)
- Learning (new skills, complex concepts)
- Difficult conversations (performance reviews, negotiations)
- Decision-making (important choices)

**Examples:**
- Writing product strategy
- Coding complex features
- Analyzing data
- Creating presentations
- Planning quarterly goals

### Medium-Energy Hours

**Schedule:**
- Meetings (collaborative, but not deep)
- 1-on-1s (relational but not exhausting)
- Project planning
- Medium-complexity tasks
- Collaboration (pair programming, brainstorming)

**Examples:**
- Team syncs
- Customer calls
- Reviewing pull requests
- Planning sprints

### Low-Energy Hours

**Schedule:**
- Email (processing, responding)
- Slack (catching up, responding)
- Administrative tasks (expense reports, scheduling)
- Routine tasks (filing, organizing)
- Shallow work (see `08-time-blocking-deep-work.md`)

**Examples:**
- Inbox zero
- Updating Jira tickets
- Scheduling meetings
- Reading industry news
- Organizing files

### Example Daily Energy Schedule (Bear Chronotype)

**7:00am-8:00am: LOW ENERGY**
- Morning routine (exercise, breakfast)

**8:00am-9:00am: WARMING UP**
- Email triage, Slack catch-up, plan day

**9:00am-10:00am: MEDIUM ENERGY**
- Team standup, quick meetings

**10:00am-1:00pm: HIGH ENERGY (BPT) ⭐**
- DEEP WORK: Product strategy document

**1:00pm-2:00pm: CRASH**
- Lunch, walk, recovery

**2:00pm-3:00pm: LOW ENERGY**
- Admin work, email responses

**3:00pm-5:00pm: MEDIUM ENERGY**
- Meetings, collaboration, 1-on-1s

**5:00pm-6:00pm: LOW ENERGY**
- Wrap up, plan tomorrow, Slack

**Notice:** The most important work (product strategy) happens during BPT (10am-1pm). Everything else works around it.

## Energy Renewal Strategies

**You can't maintain peak energy for 8 straight hours. You need to renew.**

### Physical Energy Renewal

**1. Movement breaks every 90 minutes**
- Walk around the office
- Stretch
- Do 10 pushups
- Get water

**Why:** Our bodies operate in 90-minute ultradian rhythms. After 90 mins, energy dips.

**2. Lunch walks**
- 15-30 minute walk after lunch
- Resets energy for afternoon
- Counteracts post-lunch dip

**3. Exercise daily**
- **Lions:** Morning exercise (6-7am)
- **Bears:** Late morning or early evening
- **Wolves:** Evening (7-8pm)
- **Dolphins:** Morning (helps with sleep)

**Impact:** Regular exercise increases baseline energy 20-30%

### Mental Energy Renewal

**1. Task switching**
- After 90-120 mins of deep work, switch to different task type
- Deep work → meeting → admin work → deep work
- Variation prevents burnout

**2. Digital detox breaks**
- Every 2 hours, take 10 mins with NO screens
- Look out window
- Chat with colleague in person
- Close your eyes

**3. Mindfulness/meditation**
- Even 5 minutes helps
- Resets mental clarity
- Reduces decision fatigue

### Emotional Energy Renewal

**1. Social connection**
- Lunch with colleagues (not alone at desk)
- Coffee breaks with friends
- Quick personal calls

**2. Wins & gratitude**
- End of day: Write down 3 wins
- Reinforces progress
- Maintains motivation

**3. Boundaries**
- Shutdown ritual at end of day (see `08-time-blocking-deep-work.md`)
- No work email after 6pm
- Weekends are for recovery

## Sleep: The Foundation of Energy

**Everything else fails if you're not sleeping enough.**

### The Science

**Adults need 7-9 hours nightly** (not 6, not 5)

**Effects of sleep deprivation:**
- Cognitive function drops 30-40%
- Decision-making impaired (similar to being drunk)
- Emotional regulation decreases
- Creativity tanks
- Memory consolidation fails

**You can't "catch up" on weekends. Consistent sleep is required.**

### Sleep Optimization

**1. Consistent schedule**
- Same bedtime and wake time (even weekends)
- Your circadian rhythm thrives on consistency

**2. Sleep environment**
- Dark (blackout curtains or eye mask)
- Cool (65-68°F optimal)
- Quiet (earplugs or white noise)

**3. Pre-sleep routine (60-90 minutes before bed)**
- Dim lights (signals melatonin production)
- No screens (blue light disrupts sleep)
- Reading, stretching, meditation

**4. Avoid:**
- Caffeine after 2pm
- Alcohol before bed (disrupts REM sleep)
- Large meals within 3 hours of sleep
- Intense exercise within 3 hours of sleep

**Special note for Dolphins:** Sleep hygiene is extra critical. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is highly effective.

## The Energy Budget

**Think of energy like a bank account:**

**Morning:** 100 energy points (after good sleep)

**Deep work (2 hours):** -40 points → 60 remaining

**Meeting:** -10 points → 50 remaining

**Lunch + walk:** +20 points → 70 remaining

**More deep work (1 hour):** -20 points → 50 remaining

**Email/admin:** -10 points → 40 remaining

**Evening:** 40 points remaining (enough for personal life)

**Depletion happens when:**
- You do deep work during low-energy hours (costs 2x energy)
- You skip breaks (no renewal)
- You handle unexpected crises (costs 30+ points)
- You sleep poorly (start day with 60 points instead of 100)

**The goal: Maximize ROI on your energy investment**
- Spend peak energy on highest-value work
- Renew strategically throughout day
- Protect sleep

## Working with Your Organization's Schedule

**"But my company has 9am meetings!"**

**Reality:** Most companies have default schedules that ignore chronotypes.

**Strategies:**

**1. Communicate your peak hours**
> "I'm most productive 10am-1pm. I'm protecting that time for deep work. I'm available for meetings 2-5pm."

**2. Decline early meetings when possible**
> "Can we move this to afternoon? I have a prior commitment." (Your BPT is a commitment to yourself)

**3. Request flexibility**
> "I'd like to try a flex schedule: 10am-6pm instead of 9-5. Can we pilot this for a month?"

**4. Remote work as leverage**
- If remote, you have more control
- Schedule meetings during medium-energy hours
- Protect BPT

**5. If you're a manager: Model energy-aware scheduling**
- Don't schedule 8am meetings
- Ask team members about their peak hours
- Build team calendar around collective energy

## Energy Management for Wolves (Special Section)

**Wolves face unique challenges in standard work environments.**

**The problem:** Most companies operate on Lion/Bear schedules (9am-5pm). Wolves are still warming up at 9am.

**Survival strategies for Wolves:**

**1. Front-load low-energy work**
- 9-11am: Email, admin, planning
- Saves deep work for your peak (5-8pm)

**2. Seek flexibility**
- Request 10am-6pm schedule
- Or remote work (more flexibility)
- Or async-first companies (no meeting culture)

**3. Leverage your evening advantage**
- While others are done at 5pm, you're peaking
- Use 5-8pm for creative breakthroughs
- Less interruptions in evening

**4. Don't fight your biology**
- Sleeping in ≠ laziness
- You're wired for evening productivity
- Own it, optimize for it

**Career advice for Wolves:** Choose companies/roles with flexibility. Avoid cultures that worship 8am starts.

## The Energy Audit Template

**Track for one week:**

| Day/Time | Energy (1-10) | Activity | Notes |
|----------|--------------|----------|-------|
| Mon 8am | 4 | Email | Hard to focus |
| Mon 10am | 8 | Deep work | In flow |
| Mon 12pm | 9 | Deep work | Peak performance |
| Mon 1pm | 5 | Lunch | Crashing |
| Mon 2pm | 3 | Meeting | Struggling to engage |
| Mon 4pm | 6 | Admin | Acceptable |

**After one week:**

**Insights:**
- My BPT = 10am-1pm (energy 8-9)
- My lowest = 2-3pm (post-lunch crash)
- My chronotype = Bear (based on pattern)

**Actions:**
- Protect 10am-1pm for deep work (no meetings)
- Schedule meetings 3-5pm (after crash)
- Take walk at 1pm (renewal)
- Move admin work to 8-9am (warming up)

## Summary: Energy Is Everything

**Key principles:**
1. **Your chronotype is fixed** (work with it, not against it)
2. **Not all hours are equal** (some are worth 3x others)
3. **Identify your Biological Prime Time** (your 3-4 peak hours)
4. **Match tasks to energy levels** (deep work during BPT, admin during crashes)
5. **Renew strategically** (breaks, movement, sleep)
6. **Sleep is non-negotiable** (7-9 hours consistently)
7. **Protect your peak hours** (this is your competitive advantage)

**The 80/20 of energy management:**
- 20% of your hours create 80% of your output
- Those 20% = your BPT
- Protect those hours at all costs
