# Delegation Mastery

*Delegation is prioritization through others. When you delegate well, you free yourself to focus on highest-value work.*

## Why Delegation is Prioritization

**You have limited time. You face two choices:**
1. Do everything yourself → Burn out, bottleneck, limited impact
2. Delegate effectively → Scale yourself, develop team, multiply impact

**Delegation is NOT:**
- ❌ Dumping work you don't want to do
- ❌ Abdicating responsibility
- ❌ Micromanaging someone else's execution

**Delegation IS:**
- ✅ Matching the right task to the right person
- ✅ Giving authority with responsibility
- ✅ Developing your team's capabilities
- ✅ Freeing yourself for higher-value work

## The Delegation Decision Matrix

**For every task, ask:** "Should I do this, or should someone else?"

```
               │ Only I Can Do │ Others Can Do
───────────────┼───────────────┼──────────────
High Value     │   DO MYSELF   │  DELEGATE +
to Company     │               │  OVERSIGHT
───────────────┼───────────────┼──────────────
Low Value      │  AUTOMATE OR  │  DELEGATE
to Company     │  ELIMINATE    │  FULLY
```

**Do myself:** Core strategic work, unique expertise, vision-setting
**Delegate + oversight:** High-stakes work that develops others
**Delegate fully:** Routine work others can own
**Automate/eliminate:** Why are we doing this at all?

## The Eisenhower Matrix for Delegation

**Map your tasks:**

```
            │ Urgent │ Not Urgent
────────────┼────────┼───────────
Important   │   Q1   │    Q2
            │   DO   │    DO
────────────┼────────┼───────────
Not         │   Q3   │    Q4
Important   │DELEGATE│ ELIMINATE
```

**Q3 tasks = prime delegation candidates**
- Urgent but not important = other people's priorities
- Examples: Status update emails, most meetings, approvals, info requests

**Why people struggle:** Q3 feels urgent, so you do it. But it's not moving your needle.

## What to Delegate

**Good delegation candidates:**
- **Below your pay grade** (tasks a more junior person could do)
- **80% as good** (others can do 80% as well as you)
- **Development opportunities** (stretch assignments for your team)
- **Repetitive tasks** (routines, processes)
- **Specialized skills others have** (design, analytics, etc.)

**What NOT to delegate:**
- **Core strategic decisions** (setting vision, strategy)
- **Personnel issues** (hiring, firing, sensitive feedback)
- **Unique expertise** (only you can do this)
- **Relationship building** (key customer/stakeholder relationships)
- **Crisis management** (when stakes are highest)

**Rule of thumb:** If someone else can do it 80% as well, delegate it.

## MIT Sloan's Four Levels of Delegation

**Match the level to the person's capability and task complexity:**

### Level 1: Tell (Low Autonomy)
**You decide. They execute exactly as instructed.**

**When to use:**
- Brand new employee
- Critical task, no room for error
- Person has never done this before

**Example:**
> "Please send this exact email to these 10 customers by 5pm today. Use this template. Don't change anything."

### Level 2: Sell (Medium-Low Autonomy)
**You decide and explain why. They execute with some input.**

**When to use:**
- Developing employee
- Moderately complex task
- Want them to learn reasoning

**Example:**
> "We need to send this email because [reason]. Here's the template I'd use and why. What do you think? Any concerns? Okay, please send by 5pm."

### Level 3: Consult (Medium-High Autonomy)
**They propose. You review and approve. They execute.**

**When to use:**
- Experienced employee
- Complex task requiring judgment
- Want them to own the solution

**Example:**
> "We need to communicate this change to customers. Can you draft the email and bring it to me for review? I trust your judgment, just want to align before sending."

### Level 4: Delegate (Full Autonomy)
**They own it. They decide, execute, inform you of outcome.**

**When to use:**
- Senior/expert employee
- Task in their domain of expertise
- High trust, low risk

**Example:**
> "Please handle the customer communication for this change. Your call on messaging, timing, channel. Just let me know when it's done."

**Key insight:** Match level to person + task. Don't Level 1 an experienced person. Don't Level 4 a newbie on critical task.

## The Delegation Conversation

**When delegating, cover these 6 elements:**

### 1. Context (Why)
"Here's why this matters. Here's how it fits into the bigger picture."

### 2. Outcome (What)
"Here's what success looks like. Here's how we'll measure it."

### 3. Constraints (Boundaries)
"Here's the budget/timeline/scope. Here's what you can't do."

### 4. Authority (Decision Rights)
"Here are the decisions you can make. Here's when you need my approval."

### 5. Resources (Support)
"Here's who can help. Here are the tools you need. Here's the budget."

### 6. Checkpoints (When)
"Let's check in on [date]. If you hit blockers, ping me immediately."

**Example delegation conversation:**
> "I'm delegating the Q3 sales enablement deck to you. **Context:** This is critical for our Q3 pipeline - sales needs this to close enterprise deals. **Outcome:** A 20-slide deck that explains our new pricing model, includes competitive positioning, has ROI calculator. Due Sept 1. **Constraints:** Must align with brand guidelines, must be reviewed by legal for claims. Budget: Up to $2K for design help if needed. **Authority:** You own the content, design, and messaging. I'll review draft before you share with sales. **Resources:** Talk to Sarah in Sales Ops for data, use our designer Jake. **Checkpoints:** Let's review draft on Aug 15. Questions?"

## Following Up Without Micromanaging

**The balance:** Stay informed without hovering.

**Strategies:**

**1. Agree on checkpoint schedule upfront**
> "Let's check in every Friday at 3pm for 15 mins. Otherwise, assume you're on track."

**2. Ask about progress, not methods**
> "How's it going?" (good)
> "Did you do X, Y, Z exactly as I would?" (micromanaging)

**3. Focus on outcomes**
> "Are we on track to hit the deadline with quality?" vs. "Show me every step you've taken."

**4. Create psychological safety**
> "If you hit blockers, I want to know early. No judgment - I'd rather fix it now than be surprised at the deadline."

**5. Trust, but verify**
> Early in relationship: More frequent check-ins
> Proven track record: Less frequent

**6. Watch for red flags**
> Missing checkpoints, vague updates, avoiding questions = intervene

## Common Delegation Failures

### 1. Unclear Expectations
**Problem:** "Figure it out" delegation without clear outcome.
**Fix:** Use the 6-element delegation conversation.

### 2. Micromanagement
**Problem:** Delegating outcome but micromanaging process.
**Fix:** Focus on WHAT (outcome), not HOW (method). Let them find their path.

### 3. Reverse Delegation
**Problem:** They bring problems back, you solve them (work returns to you).
**Fix:** "What do you think we should do?" Make them propose solutions.

### 4. No Follow-Up
**Problem:** Delegate and forget. Surprise at deadline.
**Fix:** Schedule checkpoints upfront.

### 5. Wrong Person
**Problem:** Delegating complex task to inexperienced person.
**Fix:** Match task complexity to person's capability. Start small, build up.

### 6. Rescuing Too Quickly
**Problem:** They struggle, you take it back immediately.
**Fix:** Let them struggle (within reason). Struggle = learning. Only rescue if true emergency.

**Example of reverse delegation:**

**Wrong:**
> Team member: "I'm stuck on X. What should I do?"
> You: "Oh, let me just do it." [Work returns to you]

**Right:**
> Team member: "I'm stuck on X. What should I do?"
> You: "What options have you considered? What do you think is best? Why?"
> [They propose solution]
> You: "Great, try that. Let me know how it goes."

## Matching Tasks to Strengths

**Good delegation = right task to right person.**

**Know your team:**
- What are they good at?
- What do they want to learn?
- What energizes them?
- What drains them?

**Match:**
- **Strengths-based delegation:** Let them do what they're great at (high performance)
- **Stretch delegation:** Give them something just beyond current ability (development)

**Example:**
- Sarah is great at presentations → Delegate customer-facing decks
- Mike wants to learn product strategy → Delegate smaller product decision (stretch)
- Jordan is detail-oriented → Delegate data analysis work
- Taylor loves writing → Delegate blog posts

**Interest alignment = better execution.** People perform better on tasks they care about.

## Building a Delegation Culture

**If you're a manager, your job is to develop a team that can work without you.**

**Signs of good delegation culture:**
- You can take a vacation without everything breaking
- Your team members make decisions confidently
- You're focused on strategic work, not tactical execution
- Your team is growing in capability

**Signs of poor delegation culture:**
- You're the bottleneck (everything waits for you)
- Team members don't make decisions without asking you
- You work more hours than your team
- Your team isn't developing new skills

**How to build it:**
1. **Model delegation** (show it's not about dumping work)
2. **Celebrate successful delegation** (recognize team members who own outcomes)
3. **Make it safe to try and fail** (delegation requires learning)
4. **Develop delegation skills in your team** (they should delegate too)

## Delegation for Individual Contributors

**"I don't manage anyone. How do I delegate?"**

**You CAN delegate even as an IC:**

**1. Upward delegation** (to your manager)
> "This is outside my scope. Can you handle X, or delegate to someone else?"

**2. Lateral delegation** (to peers)
> "I'm swamped. Can you take this on? Happy to reciprocate later."

**3. Automation** (delegate to technology)
> "Can we automate this repetitive task?"

**4. Outsourcing** (delegate to contractors/agencies)
> "Can we hire a freelancer for this design work?"

**5. Elimination** (delegate to nobody)
> "Does this actually need to be done? Can we just stop doing it?"

## Summary: The Delegation Mindset

**Shift from:**
- "It's faster if I do it myself" → "It's faster THIS TIME, but slower long-term"
- "Nobody can do it as well as me" → "Others can do it 80% as well, which is good enough"
- "I'll lose control" → "I'll gain leverage"
- "It's my job to do everything" → "My job is to ensure everything gets done (not do it myself)"

**Key principles:**
1. **Delegate outcomes, not methods** (what, not how)
2. **Match task to person's capability** (right level of delegation)
3. **Clear communication** (6-element delegation conversation)
4. **Follow up without micromanaging** (trust but verify)
5. **Let them struggle and learn** (don't rescue too quickly)
6. **Build delegation as a culture** (not a one-time thing)

**When you delegate well, you multiply your impact through others.**
