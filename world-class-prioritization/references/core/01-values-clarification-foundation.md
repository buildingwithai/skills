# Values Clarification Foundation

*You can't prioritize what you haven't defined. Before frameworks, before tactics, before daily plans—you need to know what actually matters to you.*

## Why Values Come First

Here's the brutal truth: **You can be incredibly efficient at climbing the wrong mountain.**

You can:
- Master every productivity framework
- Optimize your calendar perfectly
- Say no to all the right things
- Achieve all your goals

...and still feel empty, stressed, or like you're living someone else's life.

**Why?** Because you optimized for the wrong scorecard.

### The Prioritization Pyramid

Effective prioritization works in layers:

```
                    DAILY TASKS
                  (What you do today)
                        ↑
               WEEKLY/MONTHLY GOALS
                 (What you focus on)
                        ↑
            QUARTERLY/ANNUAL OBJECTIVES
                (What you achieve)
                        ↑
                  LIFE VALUES
             (What actually matters)
```

**Most people start at the top** (daily tasks) and wonder why they feel scattered.

**Effective prioritizers start at the bottom** (values) and work up.

### What Happens When You Skip Values Clarification

**Scenario 1: The Successful Failure**
> "I'm a VP at a tech company making $400K. I worked 80-hour weeks for 10 years to get here. My dad always wanted me to be an executive. But I'm miserable. I dream about teaching high school math. I feel trapped."

**What went wrong:** He climbed someone else's mountain (dad's values, not his).

**Scenario 2: The Overcommitted Optimizer**
> "I said yes to everything—board position, side project, mentoring, podcast. All good opportunities! But I'm burned out and my marriage is struggling. I thought I was prioritizing well."

**What went wrong:** She prioritized "good opportunities" without checking against core values (family, health).

**Scenario 3: The Goal Achiever Who Feels Empty**
> "I hit all my goals this year—promotion, revenue target, launched product. But I feel... nothing. Like, 'Is this it?' I don't even know what I want anymore."

**What went wrong:** He set goals that looked good on paper, not aligned with what brings him fulfillment.

### The Pattern

In every case: **Lack of values clarity led to optimizing for the wrong things.**

- You can't prioritize between two opportunities if you don't know what you value
- You can't say no confidently if you don't know what you're saying yes to
- You can't avoid burnout if you're pursuing someone else's definition of success

**Values are the foundation for all prioritization.**

## What Are Values?

**Values** are your core beliefs about what matters in life. They're your internal compass—what guides decisions when no one is watching.

**Values are NOT:**
- ❌ Goals (goals are destinations; values are directions)
- ❌ Should (what society/parents/peers think you should value)
- ❌ Aspirational (what you wish you valued)

**Values ARE:**
- ✅ What you actually care about (revealed by your choices, not your words)
- ✅ Personal (your values, not anyone else's)
- ✅ Directional (you never "achieve" a value; you live it continuously)

### Examples of Common Values

**Personal:**
- Family, friendship, love, connection
- Health, vitality, physical well-being
- Freedom, autonomy, independence
- Security, stability, safety
- Growth, learning, self-improvement
- Creativity, self-expression, art
- Adventure, novelty, exploration
- Fun, playfulness, joy
- Contribution, service, making a difference
- Spirituality, faith, purpose

**Professional:**
- Achievement, excellence, mastery
- Impact, influence, changing the world
- Leadership, responsibility, authority
- Collaboration, teamwork, belonging
- Innovation, creativity, building new things
- Learning, growth, skill development
- Autonomy, independence, ownership
- Recognition, status, prestige
- Compensation, financial security
- Work-life balance, flexibility
- Meaning, purpose, alignment with mission

**Universal:**
- Integrity, honesty, authenticity
- Kindness, compassion, empathy
- Courage, bravery, taking risks
- Resilience, perseverance, grit
- Gratitude, appreciation, contentment
- Curiosity, wonder, openness

### Your Values Are Unique

Two people can have the same role but different values:

**PM #1:**
- Values: Achievement, recognition, career growth
- Priorities: Promotions, visibility, big launches
- Happy when: Getting promoted, presenting to execs

**PM #2:**
- Values: Learning, autonomy, work-life balance
- Priorities: Interesting problems, flexible schedule, time with family
- Happy when: Solving hard problem, leaving at 5pm guilt-free

Neither is right or wrong. They're just **different**. And they'll prioritize completely differently.

If PM #1 tries to live by PM #2's values (or vice versa), they'll be miserable.

## Personal Values Assessment

Let's figure out YOUR values (not what you think they should be).

### Exercise 1: The Narrowing Process (50 → 10 → 5)

**Step 1: List 50 values** (or pick from the list above)
Don't filter yet. Just brainstorm everything that might matter.

**Step 2: Narrow to 10**
Go through your list and circle the 10 that resonate most. Ask for each:
- "Is this actually important to me, or do I think it should be?"
- "Do my actions reflect this value?"

**Step 3: Narrow to 5 core values**
This is the hard part. From your 10, pick the 5 that are non-negotiable.

Ask: "If I could only keep 5, which would they be?"

These are your **core values**. Everything else is secondary.

### Exercise 2: Peak Experience Analysis

**Think of 3-5 times you felt most fulfilled, alive, or "in flow."**

For each experience, ask:
- What were you doing?
- Who were you with?
- What about it felt so good?
- What values were you honoring?

**Example:**
> "I felt most alive when I was teaching a workshop to 20 developers. I loved the challenge of making complex topics simple, seeing people have 'aha!' moments, and feeling like I was making a real difference."

**Values revealed:** Teaching/mentoring, mastery, impact, contribution

**Pattern across experiences:** If the same values keep showing up, they're core.

### Exercise 3: Peak Frustration Analysis

**Think of 3-5 times you felt most frustrated, drained, or resentful.**

For each, ask:
- What was happening?
- What felt wrong?
- What value was being violated?

**Example:**
> "I was furious when my manager kept micromanaging me. I felt like I couldn't make decisions. I was just executing someone else's plan with no input."

**Value violated:** Autonomy, ownership, trust

**Why this matters:** Violated values cause disproportionate frustration. If something bothers you more than it "should," a core value is being stepped on.

### Exercise 4: The Energy Audit

**For one week, track what energizes vs. drains you.**

At the end of each day:
- What gave you energy today?
- What drained you?
- Why?

**After a week, look for patterns:**
- Activities that consistently energize = aligned with values
- Activities that consistently drain = misaligned with values

**Example pattern:**
- Energized by: 1-on-1s with team, solving hard problems, writing
- Drained by: All-hands meetings, status update emails, bureaucracy

**Values revealed:** Connection, mastery, autonomy (vs. visibility, hierarchy, process)

### Exercise 5: The Deathbed Test

**Imagine you're 80 years old, looking back on your life.**

What do you want to have prioritized?
- What do you want to be known for?
- What relationships mattered most?
- What are you proud of?
- What do you regret NOT doing?

**This reveals long-term values** (vs. short-term wants).

**Example:**
> "At 80, I won't care about my job title or salary. I'll care that I was present for my kids' childhoods, that I took the creative risks I was scared of, and that I helped people."

**Values revealed:** Family, courage, contribution (not status, wealth)

---

## Professional Values Assessment

Your professional values might overlap with personal values, or they might be different. That's okay.

### Common Professional Values

**Achievement-oriented:**
- Climbing the ladder quickly
- Hitting ambitious targets
- Winning awards/recognition
- Building a big team

**Impact-oriented:**
- Making a difference
- Solving important problems
- Changing an industry
- Helping customers deeply

**Learning-oriented:**
- Constant skill growth
- Working with smart people
- Solving novel problems
- Building expertise

**Lifestyle-oriented:**
- Flexible schedule
- Remote work
- Work-life boundaries
- Sustainable pace

**Compensation-oriented:**
- High salary
- Equity upside
- Financial security
- Building wealth

**Culture-oriented:**
- Belonging to a team
- Company mission alignment
- Collaborative environment
- Values-driven company

### Exercise: Work Values Sort

**List your top 5 professional values.**

Then rank them. When they conflict, which wins?

**Example conflict scenarios:**

**Scenario 1:** New job offer
- Option A: Director title (achievement), $250K salary (compensation), 60-hr weeks (lifestyle trade-off)
- Option B: IC role (no title), $200K salary, 40-hr weeks, fascinating problem (learning)

**Which do you pick?** Your answer reveals which values win.

**Scenario 2:** Project choice
- Option A: High-visibility project (achievement), boring problem (learning trade-off)
- Option B: Low-visibility, fascinating problem (learning), no recognition (achievement trade-off)

**Which do you pick?**

There's no right answer—only YOUR answer based on YOUR values.

### Company Culture Alignment

**Your values should align with your company's values** (or you'll be miserable).

**Misalignment examples:**

**Your values: Autonomy, experimentation, speed**
**Company culture: Process, approvals, risk aversion**
→ You'll be frustrated constantly

**Your values: Stability, clear direction, work-life balance**
**Company culture: Fast-paced startup, constant pivots, all-in mentality**
→ You'll feel overwhelmed and unsupported

**Your values: Collaboration, consensus, inclusion**
**Company culture: Move fast and break things, individual ownership, decisive leadership**
→ You'll feel steamrolled

**When values misalign:** You have three options:
1. Change companies (find better fit)
2. Change your values (rarely works)
3. Stay miserable (not recommended)

### Role Alignment

**Different roles suit different values.**

**IC (Individual Contributor) values:**
- Deep work, mastery, autonomy, technical excellence

**Manager values:**
- People development, coordination, influence, organizational impact

**Executive values:**
- Strategy, vision, organizational design, leadership

**If you value deep technical work but become a manager, you'll be frustrated** (managing ≠ doing).

**If you value impact through people but stay IC, you'll be frustrated** (limited leverage).

**Know your values → pick the right role.**

## Values Bulls-Eye Assessment

Once you've identified your core values, assess **how well you're living them.**

### The Bulls-Eye Visual

Imagine concentric circles (like a target):
- **Center (Bulls-eye):** Living this value fully
- **Middle ring:** Somewhat living this value
- **Outer ring:** Barely living this value
- **Outside the target:** Not living this value at all

### How to Use It

**For each of your 5 core values:**

1. **Plot your current behavior** (where are you actually?)
2. **Identify the gap** (where do you want to be?)
3. **Make a plan** (how do you close the gap?)

**Example:**

**Value: Family/Connection**
- **Ideal (bulls-eye):** Present with family, phone away, quality time daily
- **Current (outer ring):** Physically present but mentally at work, checking email during dinner
- **Gap:** Not in bulls-eye; need to create boundaries

**Action plan:**
- No phone at dinner (starting tonight)
- Block 1 hour after work for kids (no exceptions)
- Weekly date night with partner (calendar hold)

**Value: Learning/Growth**
- **Ideal:** Constantly learning new skills, reading, taking courses
- **Current (middle ring):** Reading occasionally, but no structured learning
- **Gap:** Want to be more intentional

**Action plan:**
- 30 mins reading every morning (before email)
- One course per quarter (already signed up for next one)
- Weekly learning review (what did I learn this week?)

### Scoring Your Alignment (Optional)

For each value, score 1-10:
- **10:** Living this value fully (bulls-eye)
- **7-9:** Mostly living it (middle ring)
- **4-6:** Somewhat living it (outer ring)
- **1-3:** Barely living it (outside target)

**Total score:** Add up all 5 values = Max 50

**Interpret:**
- **40-50:** Strong alignment (keep it up)
- **30-39:** Moderate alignment (focus on gaps)
- **20-29:** Weak alignment (major changes needed)
- **Below 20:** Misaligned (you're living someone else's life)

**Revisit monthly or quarterly:** Are you moving toward the bulls-eye or away from it?

---

## Living in Alignment vs. Out of Alignment

### Symptoms of Alignment

When your actions match your values, you feel:
- **Energized** (even when tired, work feels meaningful)
- **Clear** (decisions are easier; you know what to say no to)
- **Confident** (no second-guessing; you know it's right)
- **Content** (even if not "successful" by external measures)
- **Resilient** (setbacks hurt less; you recover faster)

**You can explain your choices easily:**
> "I turned down the VP job because I value deep technical work over management. The pay was great, but it wasn't aligned with who I am."

### Symptoms of Misalignment

When your actions contradict your values, you feel:
- **Drained** (even easy tasks feel exhausting)
- **Scattered** (can't focus; everything feels important)
- **Anxious** (constant second-guessing)
- **Resentful** (angry at others, yourself, your situation)
- **Empty** (achieving goals doesn't feel good)

**You can't explain your choices:**
> "I don't know why I took this job. The money is good, I guess. Everyone said I should. But I hate it."

### The Cost of Misalignment

**Research shows** people living out of alignment experience:
- Higher stress, anxiety, depression
- Lower life satisfaction (even with "success")
- Worse health outcomes
- Relationship strain
- Career plateaus (lack of motivation)

**Anecdote:**
> "I spent 10 years as a consultant making $300K/year. I hated every minute. I valued creativity and autonomy, but I was in a billable hours, client-driven job. I finally quit to become a writer. I make $80K now. I've never been happier. I wish I'd done it sooner."

**The cost of misalignment: 10 years of unhappiness.**

## Values Conflict Resolution

### When Personal and Professional Values Clash

**Common conflict: Family vs. Career**

Your personal values: Family, presence, connection
Your professional values: Achievement, impact, growth

**The conflict:** Big project requires 60-hour weeks for 3 months. Career-defining opportunity. But you'll miss your kid's soccer games, bedtime, weekends.

**How to resolve:**

**Option 1: Seasonal Prioritization**
> "This is a 3-month sprint. I value both family and career. I'll go all-in on the project (career), then take 2 weeks off after and return to 40-hour weeks (family). I'm choosing to emphasize career THIS season, family next season."

**Option 2: Negotiate Boundaries**
> "I'll do the project, but I need to leave by 6pm 3 days a week for family dinner. I'll work weekends to make up the hours if needed. Non-negotiable."

**Option 3: Say No**
> "I'm in a life season where family comes first. I'll pass on this project. My career will have other opportunities. My kid's childhood won't."

**None of these is "right"—only right FOR YOU based on YOUR values.**

### When Two Core Values Compete

**Example: Freedom vs. Security**

You value both freedom (autonomy, flexibility, adventure) and security (stability, predictability, safety).

**The conflict:**
- Freedom says: Quit your job, start a company, travel the world
- Security says: Keep the stable job, steady paycheck, health insurance

**How to resolve:**

**1. Define what each value means to YOU**
- Freedom: Does it mean NO job? Or flexible job? Remote work?
- Security: Does it mean guaranteed paycheck? Or 6-month emergency fund?

**2. Find the overlap**
- Can you have both? (Remote job = freedom + security)
- Small business with steady clients = entrepreneurship + stability

**3. Sequence them**
- "I'll prioritize security for 2 years (build savings), then prioritize freedom (start company with runway)."

**4. Accept trade-offs**
- "I value freedom more than security right now. I'll take the risk."

### Using Regret Minimization to Resolve Conflicts

**When stuck between two values, ask:**
> "At 80 years old, which choice will I regret more?"

**Example:**
- Stay in safe job (security) vs. Start risky company (freedom/impact)
- At 80: Will I regret staying? Or trying and failing?
- Answer reveals which value matters more LONG-TERM

## Practical Values Exercises

### Exercise 6: The Calendar Audit

**Your calendar reveals your actual priorities** (not your stated values).

**Step 1:** Print your last 2 weeks of calendar

**Step 2:** For each meeting/block, label it with the value it serves
- Staff meeting → Leadership, team development
- 1-on-1 with report → People development, connection
- Customer call → Impact, learning
- Email time → ??? (probably no value)
- Deep work block → Mastery, achievement

**Step 3:** Tally hours per value

**Step 4:** Compare to your stated core values

**If you say you value family but spent 60 hours on work and 5 on family... you're misaligned.**

**Action:** Adjust calendar to match values.

### Exercise 7: The Money Test

**How you spend money reveals what you value.**

**Step 1:** Review last 3 months of expenses

**Step 2:** Categorize by value
- $5K on vacation → Family, adventure
- $500/month on gym → Health
- $200 on books/courses → Learning
- $1K on eating out → Convenience? Social connection?

**Step 3:** Does your spending match your stated values?

**If you say you value health but spend $500/month on alcohol and $0 on gym... misalignment.**

### Exercise 8: The "Hell Yes or No" Filter

**For the next week, evaluate every request through your values.**

When someone asks for your time/energy:
1. Which of my core values does this serve?
2. If it serves a core value → "Hell yes!"
3. If it doesn't → "No."

**Example:**

Request: "Can you join our board?"

**Values check:**
- Contribution/impact → Yes
- Learning → Maybe
- Family time → No (takes 10 hours/month)

**Net:** Only say yes if contribution/impact outweighs family time cost.

**The "Hell Yes or No" rule:** If it's not a clear yes based on your values, it's a no.

### Exercise 9: The Future Self Visualization

**Close your eyes. Imagine your ideal day 1 year from now.**

Walk through the day:
- What time do you wake up?
- What's your morning routine?
- What do you work on?
- Who do you spend time with?
- How do you feel at the end of the day?

**Now ask:**
- What values is this ideal day honoring?
- How different is this from your current day?
- What needs to change to close the gap?

---

## When to Revisit Your Values

**Values aren't static.** They evolve with life stages.

**Re-assess your values when:**

### 1. Major Life Transition
- New baby (family value may increase)
- Parents aging (responsibility, caregiving may emerge)
- Health scare (health value shoots up)
- Divorce, marriage, relationship change

### 2. Career Change
- Promoted to management (values shift from doing to leading)
- Changed companies (culture fit may reveal new values)
- Burnout (realize you were violating a core value)

### 3. Feeling Misaligned
- Chronic stress, resentment, emptiness
- Success doesn't feel good
- You can't explain why you're doing what you're doing

### 4. Annually (Scheduled Check-In)
- Year-end review: Are these still my values?
- Have my priorities shifted?
- Am I living more aligned or less?

**Pro tip:** Do this during your annual planning (see: `14-quarterly-annual-planning.md`)

---

## Common Mistakes in Values Clarification

### 1. Choosing "Should" Values
**Mistake:** Listing values you think you should have (integrity, kindness, family) but don't actually prioritize.

**Fix:** Be honest. Your ACTUAL values are revealed by your TIME and MONEY, not your words.

### 2. Too Many Values
**Mistake:** Listing 15 values. Everything is important → nothing is important.

**Fix:** Force yourself to 5 core values. Prioritization requires trade-offs.

### 3. Confusing Values with Goals
**Mistake:** "My value is to get promoted" (that's a goal).

**Fix:** The value might be achievement, recognition, or growth. The goal is the promotion.

### 4. Ignoring Professional Values
**Mistake:** Only thinking about personal values, then wondering why work feels misaligned.

**Fix:** Clarify BOTH personal and professional values. They inform different domains.

### 5. Set-and-Forget
**Mistake:** Clarifying values once, never revisiting.

**Fix:** Check in quarterly or when major life change occurs.

### 6. All Talk, No Action
**Mistake:** Identifying values, feeling good about it, then changing nothing.

**Fix:** Use Values Bulls-Eye to create action plans. Close the gaps.

---

## Summary: Why This Matters for Prioritization

**You cannot prioritize effectively without values clarity.**

Here's why:

### Values Enable Better Decision-Making

**Without values:**
> "Should I take this job?"
> → Unclear. It pays more, but requires relocation. The title is better, but the work is less interesting. I don't know.

**With values (e.g., Family, Learning, Financial Security):**
> "Should I take this job?"
> → Check against values:
> - Family: Relocation means leaving support network (violates value)
> - Learning: Work is less interesting (violates value)
> - Financial security: Pays 30% more (serves value)
> → 1 out of 3 values served. **Pass.**

**Values turn fuzzy decisions into clear ones.**

### Values Enable Confident "No"

**Without values:**
> "Can you join our committee?"
> → I guess? I don't want to disappoint them. But I'm already busy. Ugh, I don't know.

**With values:**
> "Can you join our committee?"
> → Does this serve any of my 5 core values? No.
> → "Thanks for thinking of me, but I need to pass. I'm focused on [value-aligned priority]."

**Values give you permission to say no without guilt.**

### Values Prevent Burnout

**Without values:**
> → Say yes to everything that sounds good
> → Get overwhelmed
> → Burn out
> → Wonder what went wrong

**With values:**
> → Only say yes to value-aligned opportunities
> → Stay focused
> → Sustainable pace
> → Long-term success

### Values Create Fulfillment

**Without values:**
> → Achieve goals that look good externally
> → Feel empty
> → "Is this all there is?"

**With values:**
> → Achieve goals aligned with what you actually care about
> → Feel fulfilled
> → "This is what I'm here for"

## Next Steps

**Now that you understand why values matter:**

1. **Complete at least 2 of the exercises** (Narrowing Process + one other)
2. **Identify your 5 core values** (write them down)
3. **Do the Values Bulls-Eye Assessment** (where are you vs. where you want to be?)
4. **Create one action plan** to close one gap
5. **Schedule a quarterly values check-in** (calendar it now)

**Once you have values clarity, move to:**
- `02-goal-setting-frameworks.md` - Turn values into concrete goals
- `03-decision-making-frameworks.md` - Use values to make tough choices
- `10-eisenhower-matrix-daily-planning.md` - Align daily tasks with values

**Remember:** This isn't a one-time exercise. Values clarification is an ongoing practice.

You're building the foundation for everything else in this skill.

---

**Pro tip:** Share your values with someone you trust (partner, close friend, coach). Saying them out loud makes them real. And having an accountability partner helps you stay aligned.

**You can't prioritize what you haven't defined. Start here.**
