# Quarterly & Annual Planning

*"Most people overestimate what they can do in a year and underestimate what they can do in 10 years." — Bill Gates*

## The Problem: Drifting Without Direction

**January 1st:**
> "This year, I'm going to launch my side project, get promoted, and get in the best shape of my life!"

**December 31st:**
> "Where did the year go? I didn't accomplish any of those things."

**What happened?**
- Good intentions, no plan
- No quarterly breakdown (goals stay abstract)
- Life happened, priorities shifted, you reacted
- No regular review (drift unnoticed)

**The insight:** Annual goals without quarterly execution plans are just wishes.

## Why Quarterly Planning Works

**Quarterly (13 weeks) is the ideal planning horizon:**

**Not too short:**
- Long enough to accomplish meaningful outcomes
- Can ship products, build habits, achieve significant progress

**Not too long:**
- Short enough to maintain focus
- Less uncertainty than annual planning
- Can pivot if needed

**The rhythm:**
- 4 quarters per year
- 4 reviews of progress
- 4 opportunities to adjust course

**Companies do quarterly planning (OKRs, board meetings). You should too.**

## The Planning Hierarchy

**Annual → Quarterly → Monthly → Weekly → Daily**

**Annual planning:** Big picture direction (themes, major goals)

**Quarterly planning:** Specific outcomes (3-5 rocks per quarter)

**Monthly planning:** Milestones and checkpoints

**Weekly planning:** Projects and tasks (see `13-weekly-review-process.md`)

**Daily planning:** Most important tasks (see `10-eisenhower-matrix-daily-planning.md`)

**Each level informs the next.**

## Annual Planning Process (3-4 hours)

**When:** December (planning next year) OR January 1st week

**Where:** Quiet space, no distractions (coffee shop, retreat, home office)

**Tools:** Notebook, reflection prompts, calendar

### Step 1: Review the Past Year (45-60 minutes)

**Before you plan forward, look backward.**

**Life Wheel Assessment:**

Rate each area 1-10 (1 = terrible, 10 = thriving):

**Professional:**
- Career/Business: ___
- Financial: ___
- Growth/Learning: ___

**Personal:**
- Health/Fitness: ___
- Relationships/Family: ___
- Friends/Social: ___
- Fun/Recreation: ___
- Environment (home/space): ___

**Reflection Questions:**

**1. Wins & Accomplishments**
> What did I accomplish this year?

- Professional wins (promotions, launches, revenue, etc.)
- Personal wins (health, relationships, learning, etc.)
- Write 10-20 wins (be generous with yourself)

**2. Challenges & Setbacks**
> What was difficult? What didn't go as planned?

- Failed projects
- Missed goals
- Personal struggles
- Write 5-10 challenges

**3. Key Lessons**
> What did I learn?

- From wins: What worked? Why?
- From challenges: What would I do differently?
- Write 5-10 lessons

**4. Gratitude**
> What am I grateful for?

- People who supported me
- Opportunities that arose
- Luck/serendipity
- Write 5-10 gratitudes

**5. Regrets**
> What do I wish I'd done differently?

- Not "I failed X" (that's a challenge)
- But "I wish I'd prioritized Y over Z"
- Write 3-5 regrets (be honest)

**Purpose:** Learn from the past. Don't repeat mistakes. Build on wins.

### Step 2: Clarify Values (30 minutes)

**Before setting goals, reconnect with values.**

**Review your core values** (from `01-values-clarification-foundation.md`)

**Questions:**

**1. Am I living aligned with my values?**
- For each value: Rate 1-10 (how aligned am I?)
- Where are the gaps?

**2. Have my values changed?**
- What mattered to me last year vs. now?
- Any shifts in priorities?

**3. What do I want MORE of next year?**
- Based on values
- Example: Value = Growth → Want more: Learning, challenging projects

**4. What do I want LESS of next year?**
- What's not serving me?
- Example: Less: Busywork, toxic relationships, junk food

**Purpose:** Ensure goals align with values. Don't set goals that violate who you are.

### Step 3: Set Annual Themes (15 minutes)

**Instead of 20 specific goals, choose 1-3 THEMES for the year.**

**Theme = Overarching direction/focus**

**Examples:**
- "Year of Mastery" (deep skill building)
- "Year of Launch" (ship side project)
- "Year of Health" (fitness priority)
- "Year of Relationships" (invest in people)
- "Year of Financial Growth" (increase income, build savings)

**Why themes work:**
- Flexible (can adapt how you pursue them)
- Memorable (easier to recall than 20 goals)
- Guiding (helps you say yes/no to opportunities)

**Choose 1-3 themes:**
- Professional theme: ___
- Personal theme: ___
- (Optional) Life theme: ___

**Example:**
- Professional: "Year of Product Mastery" (become exceptional PM)
- Personal: "Year of Energy" (optimize health, sleep, exercise)

### Step 4: Set Annual Goals (45-60 minutes)

**Now get specific. What outcomes do you want by year-end?**

**Framework: SMART goals** (see `02-goal-setting-frameworks.md`)

**Professional Goals (3-5 goals):**

Example structure:
1. **Career:** "Get promoted to Senior PM" or "Grow side project to $5K MRR"
2. **Skills:** "Master data analysis (SQL, Amplitude)" or "Publish 12 blog posts"
3. **Network:** "Attend 3 conferences, make 20 new industry connections"
4. **Financial:** "Increase income by 20%" or "Save $15K"

**Personal Goals (3-5 goals):**

Example structure:
1. **Health:** "Lose 15 lbs, run 500 miles" or "Gym 3x/week consistently"
2. **Relationships:** "Date nights 2x/month, family trip to Europe"
3. **Learning:** "Read 24 books, learn Spanish (basic fluency)"
4. **Fun:** "Try 12 new restaurants, take pottery class"

**Total: 6-10 annual goals**

**Not 20. Not 30. 6-10 max.**

**Why fewer goals?**
- Focus (spread too thin = achieve nothing)
- Realistic (you have limited time/energy)
- Memorable (can you name all 20 goals right now?)

**Use Warren Buffett's 5/25 Rule if you have too many:**
- List 25 goals
- Circle top 5
- Avoid the other 20 at all costs

**See:** `02-goal-setting-frameworks.md`

### Step 5: Convert Goals to OKRs (Optional, 30 minutes)

**If you want more structure, use OKRs (Objectives & Key Results).**

**Format:**
- **Objective:** Qualitative goal (inspiring)
- **Key Results:** Quantitative metrics (measurable)

**Example:**

**Objective:** Become a product management expert

**Key Results:**
- KR1: Ship 3 major product features (measured by launch dates)
- KR2: Publish 12 product essays (1/month)
- KR3: Product NPS increases from 40 to 60

**Why OKRs help:**
- Clear metrics (you know when you've achieved it)
- Measurable progress (can track 0.0 to 1.0)
- Ambitious (set stretch goals)

**See:** `02-goal-setting-frameworks.md` for full OKR process

### Step 6: Preview the Year Ahead (15 minutes)

**Look at your calendar for the year.**

**Known commitments:**
- Vacations planned?
- Major work deadlines (launches, events, etc.)?
- Life events (weddings, moves, etc.)?

**Busy months:**
- Which months will be crazy? (Q4 is always busy for most companies)
- Plan lighter goals during those months

**Opportunity months:**
- Which months have more spaciousness?
- Front-load important goals into those months

**Example:**
- March: Busy (conference, product launch)
- June: Lighter (can focus on learning goal)
- September: Busy (end of Q3 push)
- November: Vacation (plan downtime)

**Adjust expectations accordingly.**

### Step 7: Commit & Share (10 minutes)

**Write your annual plan in one place:**
- Document (Notion, Evernote, Google Doc)
- Or physical journal

**Include:**
- Annual themes
- 6-10 goals
- OKRs (if using)

**Share with accountability partner:**
- Friend, coach, spouse, colleague
- Someone who will check in quarterly

**Why sharing works:** External accountability increases follow-through 2-3x

## Quarterly Planning Process (2-3 hours)

**When:** Every 13 weeks (end of previous quarter, start of new quarter)

**Cadence:**
- Q1: January 1-March 31
- Q2: April 1-June 30
- Q3: July 1-September 30
- Q4: October 1-December 31

**Where:** Retreat-style (different location, uninterrupted time)

### Step 1: Review Last Quarter (30-45 minutes)

**Before planning next quarter, review what just happened.**

**Quarterly Reflection Questions:**

**1. Did I achieve last quarter's goals?**
- List each Q goal → Achieved? Y/N?
- If OKRs: Score each KR (0.0-1.0)
- 0.7+ = success

**2. What were the wins?**
- Write 5-10 wins from the quarter
- Professional + personal

**3. What were the challenges?**
- What got in the way?
- Underestimated timelines? Unexpected crises? Energy drain?

**4. What did I learn?**
- About myself, my work, my capacity?
- What would I do differently?

**5. Time audit**
> Where did my time actually go?

- Deep work: ___ hours/week average
- Meetings: ___ hours/week
- Q2 (Important/Not Urgent): ___% of time (Goal: 50%+)

**If misaligned:** What will I change next quarter?

**6. Energy audit**
> How was my energy this quarter?

- Overall energy level: 1-10
- What drained me? (minimize next quarter)
- What energized me? (do more next quarter)

**7. Values alignment**
> Did I live according to my values?

- Review core values (from `01-values-clarification-foundation.md`)
- Rate alignment: 1-10 per value
- Where were the gaps?

**Purpose:** Learn from last quarter. Don't make the same mistakes. Double down on what worked.

### Step 2: Set Quarterly Rocks (60-90 minutes)

**Rocks = Your 3-5 most important outcomes this quarter**

**Origin:** Verne Harnish's "Scaling Up" + EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System)

**Why "rocks"?**
- Big priorities (not tiny tasks)
- If you achieve nothing else, achieving rocks = success
- Fewer than 5 (forces prioritization)

**How to choose your rocks:**

**Start with annual goals:**
- Review your 6-10 annual goals
- Which goals should move forward THIS quarter?

**Break annual goals into quarterly milestones:**

**Example:**

**Annual goal:** "Launch side project to $5K MRR"

**Q1 rock:** "Ship MVP (minimum viable product)"
**Q2 rock:** "Get first 10 paying customers"
**Q3 rock:** "Hit $1K MRR"
**Q4 rock:** "Hit $5K MRR"

**Each rock = one quarter of the annual goal.**

**Choose 3-5 rocks for this quarter:**

**Example quarterly rocks:**

**Professional (2-3 rocks):**
1. Launch Product X (with 1,000 users in first month)
2. Hire 2 PMs for team
3. Complete product strategy for 2026

**Personal (1-2 rocks):**
4. Lose 10 lbs (reach 170 lbs)
5. Read 6 books

**Total: 5 rocks**

**Characteristics of good rocks:**
- **Specific outcome** (not "improve product" → "Launch Product X with 1,000 users")
- **Measurable** (you know when it's done)
- **Achievable in 13 weeks** (not too big)
- **Important** (aligned with annual goals)
- **Focused** (3-5 rocks, not 10)

### Step 3: Define Success Criteria (15 minutes)

**For each rock, define:**

**What does "done" look like?**

**Example:**

**Rock:** "Launch Product X"

**Success criteria:**
- Product is live in production
- 1,000+ signups in first month
- NPS > 40
- No critical bugs

**Why success criteria matter:**
- Removes ambiguity (you know when you've achieved it)
- Prevents moving goalposts (done = done)
- Enables celebration (you KNOW when to celebrate)

### Step 4: Identify Obstacles (15 minutes)

**For each rock, ask:**

**What could prevent me from achieving this?**

**Example:**

**Rock:** "Launch Product X"

**Potential obstacles:**
- Engineering capacity (team is at 100%)
- Unclear requirements (need user research)
- External dependency (waiting on API integration)

**Mitigations:**
- Engineering capacity → Hire contractor OR descope features
- Unclear requirements → Schedule user research sprint this month
- External dependency → Escalate with partner, set clear deadlines

**Purpose:** Identify obstacles NOW (not when it's too late). Build mitigation plans.

### Step 5: Break Rocks into Monthly Milestones (30 minutes)

**Each rock = 13 weeks. Break it into 3 monthly milestones.**

**Example:**

**Rock:** "Launch Product X"

**Month 1 (January):** Complete design + engineering spec
**Month 2 (February):** Build core functionality (alpha version)
**Month 3 (March):** Test, fix bugs, launch publicly

**For each rock:**
- Month 1 milestone: ___
- Month 2 milestone: ___
- Month 3 milestone: ___

**Why monthly milestones help:**
- Tracks progress (are we on pace?)
- Early warning system (if Month 1 slips, adjust in Month 2)
- Prevents procrastination (can't leave everything for Month 3)

### Step 6: Calendar Blocking (15 minutes)

**Rocks don't happen by accident. Schedule them.**

**Time blocking for rocks:**

**For each rock:**
- How many hours/week needed?
- Block calendar time NOW for those hours

**Example:**

**Rock:** "Complete product strategy"

**Estimated time:** 40 hours over 13 weeks = ~3 hours/week

**Calendar block:** Every Tuesday 9am-12pm = "Product Strategy Deep Work"

**Do this for each rock.** If you don't block time, urgent tasks will crowd them out.

**See:** `08-time-blocking-deep-work.md`

### Step 7: Quarterly Intentions & Focus (10 minutes)

**Beyond rocks, set intentions:**

**1. What do I want to START this quarter?**
- New habits?
- New relationships?
- New skills?

**2. What do I want to STOP this quarter?**
- Bad habits?
- Time wasters?
- Toxic relationships?

**3. What do I want to CONTINUE this quarter?**
- What's working well?
- Don't lose momentum

**4. What's my ONE WORD for this quarter?**
- Capture the essence
- Example: "Launch", "Growth", "Health", "Focus"

**Purpose:** Sets the tone. Guides daily decisions.

### Step 8: Capacity Check (10 minutes)

**Reality check: Can you actually do this?**

**Calculate available hours:**

**13 weeks × 40 hours/week = 520 hours total**

**Minus:**
- Meetings: ~150 hours (30% of time)
- Email/Slack/Admin: ~100 hours (20%)
- **Available for focused work: ~270 hours**

**Now add up rock estimates:**
- Rock 1: 60 hours
- Rock 2: 40 hours
- Rock 3: 80 hours
- Rock 4: 30 hours
- Rock 5: 20 hours
- **Total: 230 hours**

**Buffer:** 40 hours remaining (for unexpected work, sick days, etc.)

**If rocks exceed available hours:** Descope or eliminate a rock.

**Better to achieve 4 rocks than fail at 6.**

## Monthly Check-Ins (30 minutes)

**Every month, quick review:**

**1. Rock progress**
- Each rock: On track? Behind? Ahead?
- Traffic light system: 🟢 Green (on track), 🟡 Yellow (at risk), 🔴 Red (behind)

**2. Milestone achieved?**
- Did I hit this month's milestone for each rock?
- If no: Why not? What needs to change?

**3. Obstacles encountered**
- Any new blockers?
- Mitigations working?

**4. Adjust if needed**
- Descope rock if unrealistic
- Re-prioritize if situation changed

**Monthly check-in prevents surprises at quarter-end.**

## The 13-Week Year Philosophy

**Brian Moran's "The 12 Week Year" (adapted to 13 weeks for quarter alignment)**

**Core insight:** Most people coast for 10 months, then panic in November-December.

**The fix:** Treat every quarter like it's your entire year.

**Benefits:**
- Urgency (13 weeks = short timeline, forces action)
- Focus (can't do everything, must prioritize)
- Feedback (4x per year vs. 1x per year)
- Momentum (4 wins per year vs. 1)

**Mindset shift:**
- "I have 13 weeks to make this happen" (not "I have all year")

## Quarterly Planning for Different Roles

### Individual Contributor

**Rock examples:**
- Ship 2 major features
- Present at 1 conference
- Mentor 2 junior team members
- Read 6 technical books

**Focus:** Execution, skill development, visibility

### Manager

**Rock examples:**
- Hire 3 team members
- Team achieves Q OKRs (0.7+ average)
- Implement new process (reduces cycle time 30%)
- 100% of team has development plans

**Focus:** Team success, process improvement, development

### Executive

**Rock examples:**
- Company hits revenue target ($X ARR)
- Launch new product line
- Close Series B funding
- Reduce churn by 20%

**Focus:** Business outcomes, strategic initiatives, growth

### Entrepreneur

**Rock examples:**
- Launch product (1,000 users)
- Hit $10K MRR
- Hire first employee
- Secure 10 testimonials/case studies

**Focus:** Product-market fit, revenue, scaling

## Integration with Other Frameworks

### Quarterly Planning + OKRs

**OKRs = Natural framework for quarterly rocks**

**Format:**
- Objective = Rock (outcome)
- Key Results = Success criteria (metrics)

**Example:**

**Objective (Rock):** Launch Product X successfully

**Key Results:**
- KR1: 1,000+ signups in first month
- KR2: NPS > 40
- KR3: <5 critical bugs

**See:** `02-goal-setting-frameworks.md`

### Quarterly Planning + Weekly Review

**Weekly review checks progress on quarterly rocks:**

**Every week:**
- Review each rock: What progress this week?
- Next week: What actions will move rocks forward?
- Block time for rock-related work

**See:** `13-weekly-review-process.md`

### Quarterly Planning + Values

**Before setting rocks, check alignment:**

**For each potential rock:**
- Does this align with my core values?
- If no → Don't make it a rock (even if it seems important)

**See:** `01-values-clarification-foundation.md`

### Quarterly Planning + Time Blocking

**Rocks require calendar time:**

**For each rock:**
- Estimate hours needed
- Block specific calendar slots
- Protect those blocks

**See:** `08-time-blocking-deep-work.md`

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Many Rocks

**Problem:** 10 quarterly rocks = 0 completed

**Fix:** 3-5 rocks maximum. Force prioritization.

### Mistake 2: Vague Rocks

**Problem:** "Improve product" (how do you know when it's done?)

**Fix:** Specific outcome + success criteria ("Launch Product X with 1,000 users, NPS >40")

### Mistake 3: No Time Blocking

**Problem:** Rocks are goals but not scheduled

**Fix:** Block calendar time for rock-related work

### Mistake 4: No Monthly Check-Ins

**Problem:** Realize at week 12 you're behind (too late)

**Fix:** Monthly check-ins catch problems early

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Reality

**Problem:** Ambitious rocks + no buffer = burnout

**Fix:** Capacity check. Leave 20% buffer for unexpected work.

## Summary: Plan the Year, Execute by Quarter

**Key principles:**
1. **Annual themes + goals** (big picture direction)
2. **Quarterly rocks** (specific outcomes, 3-5 per quarter)
3. **Monthly milestones** (track progress, adjust early)
4. **Weekly execution** (weekly review connects to quarterly plan)
5. **13-week urgency** (treat every quarter like a year)

**The hierarchy:**
- Annual: Direction
- Quarterly: Outcomes
- Monthly: Milestones
- Weekly: Tasks
- Daily: Actions

**Each level informs the next. Top-down clarity, bottom-up execution.**

**With this system:**
- December 31st: You'll know exactly what you achieved
- No more "where did the year go?"
- 4 cycles of feedback and improvement
- Proactive execution, not reactive drift

**Plan your year. Execute by quarter. Win.**
