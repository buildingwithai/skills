# Goal Setting Frameworks

*Values tell you the direction. Goals give you the waypoints. This is how you turn "what matters" into "what to achieve."*

## From Values to Goals

You've identified your core values (if not, see `01-values-clarification-foundation.md` first).

Now what?

**Values without goals are just nice ideas.**
- "I value health" → Okay, what are you going to DO about it?
- "I value career growth" → Great, what does success look like?
- "I value family" → Lovely, how will you prioritize it?

**Goals are how you operationalize your values.**

### The Connection

**Value → Goal → Actions**

**Example 1:**
- **Value:** Health, vitality
- **Goal:** Run a half-marathon by December
- **Actions:** Train 3x/week, hire coach, register for race

**Example 2:**
- **Value:** Career growth, achievement
- **Goal:** Get promoted to Senior PM by Q4
- **Actions:** Lead 2 major launches, improve stakeholder relationships, document wins

**Example 3:**
- **Value:** Family, connection
- **Goal:** Weekly date night with partner, bedtime routine with kids 5 nights/week
- **Actions:** Block Friday nights (no exceptions), leave work by 6:30pm

**See the pattern?** Values provide direction, goals provide destination, actions get you there.

## The Problem with Bad Goals

Most people set goals. Few people set GOOD goals.

**Bad goals are:**
- ❌ Vague ("Be healthier")
- ❌ Unmeasurable ("Do better at work")
- ❌ Unrealistic ("Become CEO in 6 months")
- ❌ Misaligned with values ("Make $1M" when you value work-life balance)
- ❌ Set-and-forget ("I'll check on this... never")

**The result:** You either ignore the goal or achieve it and feel nothing.

**Good goals are:**
- ✅ Specific (crystal clear what success looks like)
- ✅ Measurable (you know if you hit it)
- ✅ Achievable (hard but possible)
- ✅ Relevant (aligned with values)
- ✅ Time-bound (deadline creates urgency)
- ✅ Reviewed regularly (weekly, monthly, quarterly)

**This guide covers three goal-setting frameworks:**

1. **SMART Goals** - The classic (for any goal type)
2. **OKRs** - Google's framework (for ambitious outcomes)
3. **Warren Buffett's 5/25 Rule** - Focus filter (for saying no)

---

## Framework 1: SMART Goals

**Best for:** Any goal type; individuals; straightforward objectives

### What SMART Means

**S - Specific:** Clear, detailed, unambiguous
**M - Measurable:** You can track progress and know when you've achieved it
**A - Achievable:** Challenging but possible (not delusional)
**R - Relevant:** Aligned with your values and bigger picture
**T - Time-bound:** Has a deadline

### Why SMART Works

**Vague goal:** "Get better at product management"
- How do you measure "better"?
- When have you achieved it?
- What does "better" even mean?
- Result: You never feel like you've succeeded

**SMART goal:** "Complete 2 major product launches (mobile app redesign + new pricing) that each drive >10% monthly active user growth by end of Q4"
- Specific: 2 launches, named, growth metric
- Measurable: 10% MAU growth
- Achievable: (assuming you have the resources)
- Relevant: Aligned with PM career growth
- Time-bound: End of Q4
- Result: On Dec 31, you know if you hit it or not

### How to Write SMART Goals (Step-by-Step)

**Step 1: Start with your value**
What value is this goal serving?

Example: "Learning, growth, career advancement"

**Step 2: Brain dump what you want**
Write the vague version first.

Example: "I want to get better at product management"

**Step 3: Make it SPECIFIC**
What exactly would "better" look like? Get concrete.

Example: "Lead 2 major product launches successfully"

**Step 4: Make it MEASURABLE**
How will you know you achieved it? Define success metrics.

Example: "Each launch drives >10% MAU growth and <5% churn"

**Step 5: Check if it's ACHIEVABLE**
Is this possible given your resources, skills, time?

Example: "I have the team, budget, and authority to do this. Challenging but doable."

**Step 6: Check if it's RELEVANT**
Does this align with your values and bigger goals?

Example: "Yes - serves my value of career growth and learning. Directly tied to promotion criteria."

**Step 7: Set a TIME BOUND**
When will you achieve this by?

Example: "Q4 2025 (both launches complete by Dec 31)"

**Final SMART goal:** "Lead 2 major product launches (mobile app redesign + new pricing tier) by Dec 31, 2025, each driving >10% MAU growth and <5% churn, positioning me for promotion to Senior PM."

### SMART Goal Examples

**Professional:**

**Vague:** "Be a better manager"
**SMART:** "Improve team engagement score from 6.5 to 8.0 (out of 10) by Q4 through weekly 1-on-1s, monthly skip-levels, and quarterly team offsites"

**Vague:** "Learn more about AI"
**SMART:** "Complete Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization (5 courses) and build 2 production AI features for our product by end of Q2"

**Vague:** "Get promoted"
**SMART:** "Achieve promotion to Director by end of year by: (1) delivering $2M ARR from new product line, (2) building 3-person team, (3) presenting at 2 industry conferences"

**Personal:**

**Vague:** "Be healthier"
**SMART:** "Run 3x per week (12 runs/month minimum), lose 15 lbs (from 185 to 170), and complete a 10K race by June 30"

**Vague:** "Spend more time with family"
**SMART:** "Have dinner with family 5 nights/week (leave office by 6pm), attend 100% of kids' soccer games, and take 2 family vacations this year (spring break + summer)"

**Vague:** "Read more"
**SMART:** "Read 24 books this year (2 per month), mix of fiction and non-fiction, track progress in Goodreads, write summary for each"

### Common SMART Goal Mistakes

**1. "Achievable" becomes "Easy"**
- ❌ "Read 4 books this year" (too easy, no stretch)
- ✅ "Read 24 books this year" (challenging but possible)

**2. Too many goals**
- ❌ 20 SMART goals for the year
- ✅ 3-5 major goals (see 5/25 Rule below)

**3. No "why" (Relevant check fails)**
- ❌ "Learn Spanish fluently" (cool, but why? Does it serve a value?)
- ✅ "Learn conversational Spanish to communicate with wife's family" (serves relationship value)

**4. Unmeasurable metrics**
- ❌ "Be a better leader" (how do you measure?)
- ✅ "Improve team engagement score to 8.5" (clear metric)

**5. Set-and-forget**
- ❌ Write SMART goal in January, revisit in December
- ✅ Monthly check-in: "Am I on track? What needs adjustment?"

### When to Use SMART Goals

✅ **Use SMART when:**
- You need clear, achievable objectives
- You're setting individual goals (personal or professional)
- You want straightforward success criteria
- You need quarterly or annual goal-setting

❌ **Don't use SMART when:**
- You need team alignment (use OKRs)
- You want moonshot thinking (SMART emphasizes "achievable")
- You have rapidly changing priorities (SMART assumes stable context)

---

## Framework 2: OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

**Best for:** Teams, companies, ambitious outcomes, quarterly planning

### What OKRs Are

OKRs were popularized by Google (learned from Intel). They separate aspirational direction from measurable outcomes.

**Objective** = Aspirational, qualitative, inspiring
**Key Results** = Measurable, quantitative, prove you achieved the objective

**Format:**
- **Objective:** I will [aspirational outcome]
- **Key Results:**
  - KR1: [Measurable result 1]
  - KR2: [Measurable result 2]
  - KR3: [Measurable result 3]

**Rule of thumb:**
- 3-5 Objectives per quarter/year
- 3-4 Key Results per Objective

### OKR Example (Product Team)

**Objective:** Become the go-to solution for enterprise customers in fintech

**Key Results:**
1. Sign 15 new enterprise customers (>$100K ARR each)
2. Increase enterprise NPS from 42 to 60
3. Achieve 95% uptime on enterprise SLA
4. Ship SSO, audit logs, and advanced permissions by Q3

**Objective:** Delight our users with world-class onboarding

**Key Results:**
1. Reduce time-to-first-value from 14 days to 3 days
2. Increase activation rate (day-7) from 40% to 65%
3. Achieve NPS score of 50+ on onboarding experience
4. Decrease support tickets during first 30 days by 50%

**See the structure?**
- **Objective** = directional, inspiring ("become the go-to solution")
- **Key Results** = specific, measurable proof

### Personal OKRs

Yes, you can use OKRs for personal life.

**Objective:** Be an exceptional parent who's present and engaged

**Key Results:**
1. Bedtime routine with kids 5 nights/week (currently 2)
2. One-on-one time with each kid 1x/week (currently monthly)
3. Zero phone usage during family dinner (currently on phone 50% of meals)
4. Attend 100% of school events/performances

**Objective:** Achieve financial security and freedom

**Key Results:**
1. Save $50K this year (emergency fund complete)
2. Max out 401(k) and IRA ($30K total)
3. Reduce debt by $20K (from $50K to $30K)
4. Increase net worth from $150K to $220K

### How to Write OKRs

**Step 1: Start with Objectives (3-5 max)**

Ask: "What do I want to achieve this quarter/year?"

Make it:
- **Aspirational** (ambitious but not delusional)
- **Qualitative** (describes the outcome, not the numbers)
- **Inspiring** (you're excited about it)
- **Aligned with values** (check: does this serve my core values?)

Examples:
- "Become the best PM in the company"
- "Build an exceptional engineering team"
- "Achieve work-life harmony"
- "Transform our product's user experience"

**Step 2: Define Key Results (3-4 per Objective)**

For each Objective, ask: "How will I know I've achieved this?"

Make them:
- **Measurable** (numbers, metrics, completion)
- **Specific** (no ambiguity)
- **Time-bound** (by end of quarter/year)
- **Challenging** (70% confidence you'll hit them)

**The 70% Rule:** If you're 100% confident you'll hit your KRs, they're not ambitious enough. Aim for 70% confidence.

**Step 3: Check for Balance**

Do your OKRs cover:
- **Input metrics** (things you control: # of sales calls, # of releases)
- **Output metrics** (results: revenue, NPS, activation rate)
- **Different domains** (if personal: career, health, relationships, growth)

**Step 4: Commit and Share**

OKRs work best when:
- Written down
- Shared with team/manager/partner (accountability)
- Visible (not hidden in a doc you never open)

### OKRs vs. SMART Goals

| Aspect | SMART Goals | OKRs |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **Ambition** | Achievable (100% confidence) | Stretch (70% confidence) |
| **Structure** | One statement | Objective + 3-4 Key Results |
| **Best for** | Individual goals | Team alignment |
| **Focus** | Specific outcome | Aspirational direction + proof |
| **Cadence** | Annual, quarterly, project | Quarterly (most common) |
| **Failure** | Missing = bad | Hitting 70% = success |

**When to use which:**
- **SMART:** Personal goals, clear objectives, need high confidence
- **OKRs:** Team goals, ambitious outcomes, need alignment

You can use both:
- **OKRs** for quarterly company/team goals
- **SMART** for individual projects and personal goals

### OKRs and Prioritization

**Here's the magic of OKRs for prioritization:**

**Before OKRs:**
> "We have 50 feature requests. Which should we build?"
> → Everyone has opinions. Loudest voice wins. No clear criteria.

**After OKRs:**
> "We have 50 feature requests. Which move our Key Results?"
> - KR1: Increase activation to 65% → Feature X helps onboarding → Priority
> - KR2: Reduce time-to-value to 3 days → Feature Y shortens setup → Priority
> - Feature Z doesn't move any KRs → Deprioritize

**OKRs give you a filter:** If it doesn't move a Key Result, it's not a priority.

**This makes saying "no" easier:**
> "That's a cool idea, but it doesn't advance any of our Q2 OKRs. Let's revisit in Q3 planning."

### Common OKR Mistakes

**1. Too many Objectives**
- ❌ 10 Objectives (unfocused, diluted effort)
- ✅ 3-5 Objectives (focused, achievable)

**2. Objectives that are just Key Results**
- ❌ Objective: "Increase revenue by $2M" (that's a KR, not an O)
- ✅ Objective: "Become the market leader in SMB segment"
  - KR: Increase revenue by $2M

**3. Key Results you can't measure**
- ❌ KR: "Improve team morale"
- ✅ KR: "Increase team engagement score from 6.5 to 8.0"

**4. Setting and forgetting**
- ❌ Set OKRs in January, check in December
- ✅ Weekly team check-in: "How are we tracking to KRs? Need to adjust?"

**5. Hitting 100% of OKRs**
- ❌ You're not being ambitious enough
- ✅ 70% achievement = you set good stretch goals

**6. Individual OKRs that don't ladder up**
- ❌ Your OKRs totally unrelated to company OKRs
- ✅ Your OKRs contribute to team/company OKRs

### OKR Grading

At end of quarter, score each Key Result:

- **0.0 - 0.3:** Didn't make meaningful progress
- **0.4 - 0.6:** Made progress but fell short
- **0.7 - 0.8:** Delivered! (this is success)
- **0.9 - 1.0:** Crushed it (maybe too easy?)

**Example:**

**KR:** Increase activation rate from 40% to 65%
**Actual:** Achieved 58%
**Score:** 0.7 (moved from 40% to 58% = 18 points of 25-point goal = 72%)

**Total OKR score:** Average all KR scores

**Objective:** Delight users with onboarding
- KR1: Reduce time-to-value 14→3 days (actual: 7 days) → 0.5
- KR2: Increase activation 40%→65% (actual: 58%) → 0.7
- KR3: NPS score 50+ (actual: 48) → 0.6
- KR4: Reduce support tickets -50% (actual: -40%) → 0.8

**Average:** (0.5 + 0.7 + 0.6 + 0.8) / 4 = **0.65** ✅ **Success!**

**70%+ = you hit your OKR.** Celebrate and set new ones.

### When to Use OKRs

✅ **Use OKRs when:**
- You want ambitious, stretch goals
- You need team/company alignment
- You have quarterly planning cycles
- You want to prioritize by impact (filter: does it move a KR?)

❌ **Don't use OKRs when:**
- You need 100% certainty of achievement (use SMART)
- You're solo (OKRs shine for teams)
- Your environment is too chaotic (OKRs assume some stability for a quarter)

## Framework 3: Warren Buffett's 5/25 Rule

**Best for:** Extreme focus; saying no; cutting distractions

### The Origin Story

The story goes: Warren Buffett's pilot, Mike Flint, asked for career advice. Buffett gave him a 3-step exercise:

**Step 1:** List your top 25 career goals
**Step 2:** Circle your top 5 most important
**Step 3:** Everything else (the other 20) becomes your **"Avoid at All Cost" list**

**The key insight:** The 20 non-circled goals aren't "nice to have later"—they're your **biggest distraction** from the top 5.

**Buffett's advice:** "No matter what, these things get no attention from you until you've succeeded with your top 5."

**Note:** Buffett himself has said this story is apocryphal (may not have happened), but the advice is still gold.

### Why the B-List is Dangerous

**Most people think:**
- A-list goals (top 5) = highest priority
- B-list goals (next 20) = lower priority, but still worth some time
- C-list goals = ignore

**The problem:** B-list goals are **seductive.** They're good ideas! They're achievable! They're interesting!

**But they dilute your focus from the A-list.**

**Example:**

**Your top 5 (A-list):**
1. Get promoted to Director
2. Launch new product line
3. Build 10-person team
4. Improve work-life balance
5. Complete executive MBA

**Your next 20 (B-list includes):**
6. Learn Python
7. Write a book
8. Start a podcast
9. Join a startup advisory board
10. Mentor 3 junior PMs
... (and 15 more)

**What happens:** You spend 20% of time on each A-list goal and 5-10% on B-list goals. Your focus is fragmented. You make progress on nothing.

**What should happen:** 100% focus on A-list until they're done. Then pick new A-list from old B-list.

### How to Use the 5/25 Rule

**Step 1: List 25 goals** (career, personal, or both—your choice)

Don't filter yet. Brain dump everything you want to achieve in the next 1-3 years.

**Examples:**
- Career: Get promotion, learn new skill, start side project, speak at conference
- Personal: Run marathon, write book, learn instrument, travel to 10 countries
- Finance: Save $100K, invest in real estate, max retirement accounts

**Step 2: Circle your top 5**

**This is the hard part.** You can only keep 5.

**Ask for each:**
- Does this align with my core values?
- Will I regret NOT doing this in 10 years?
- Does this create leverage (enables other goals)?
- Am I excited about this, or do I think I "should" do it?

**Force the trade-off:** "If I could only achieve 5 things, which 5?"

**Step 3: The other 20 become your AVOID list**

**Critical:** Don't treat them as "I'll do these later."

**Treat them as DISTRACTIONS until the top 5 are complete.**

> "No matter what, these things get no attention from you until you've succeeded with your top 5."

**Why?** You can't focus on 25 things. You can barely focus on 5. The 20 are your biggest threat to achieving the 5.

### Example: Applying 5/25 to Career Goals

**25 career goals → Top 5:**

1. ✅ Get promoted to Senior PM by EOY
2. ✅ Launch 2 major products this year
3. ✅ Build strong relationships with C-suite
4. ✅ Improve team management skills (1-on-1s, coaching)
5. ✅ Achieve $500K comp (base + equity + bonus)

**AVOID until top 5 done (examples from the 20):**
- ❌ Learn to code (interesting but not critical for PM role)
- ❌ Start PM coaching side business (dilutes focus)
- ❌ Write articles on Medium (nice, but not moving career needle)
- ❌ Join PM conference planning committee (time sink)
- ❌ Get AWS certification (cool, but unrelated to goals)

**What this means:**
- When someone asks "Want to join the conference committee?" → "No, I'm focused on [top 5]"
- When you feel like learning to code → "Not until I hit my top 5"
- When you want to start a side business → "After I get promoted"

**The discipline:** Saying no to good ideas so you can say yes to great ones.

### Personal Life Application

**25 personal goals → Top 5:**

1. ✅ Be fully present with kids (no phone during family time)
2. ✅ Run 3x/week and complete half-marathon
3. ✅ Date night with partner every week
4. ✅ Read 24 books this year
5. ✅ Save $50K in emergency fund

**AVOID (B-list):**
- ❌ Learn guitar (fun, but not top 5)
- ❌ Renovate house (can wait)
- ❌ Start food blog (interesting, but dilutes focus)
- ❌ Join neighborhood HOA board (time sink)
- ❌ Take cooking classes (nice to have)

**What this means:**
- Guitar will wait until I've nailed the top 5
- House renovation is on hold for this year
- No new commitments (HOA, blog) until top 5 are habits

### Combining 5/25 with OKRs or SMART

**You can use 5/25 as a filter for OKRs/SMART goals:**

**Step 1:** Brain dump 25 possible goals
**Step 2:** Use 5/25 to narrow to top 5
**Step 3:** Convert top 5 to SMART goals or OKRs

**Example:**

**Top 5 from 5/25 exercise:**
1. Get promoted
2. Launch 2 products
3. Improve work-life balance
4. Build team skills
5. Achieve comp target

**Convert to OKRs:**

**Objective 1:** Achieve promotion to Senior PM

**Key Results:**
- Deliver 2 successful product launches (>10% MAU growth each)
- Improve manager rating from "meets" to "exceeds" expectations
- Present to exec team 3x this year (visibility)
- Build 3-person team successfully

**Objective 2:** Achieve sustainable work-life balance

**Key Results:**
- Leave office by 6pm 4 days/week
- Zero work on weekends (currently working Saturdays)
- Take 3 weeks PTO (currently taking 1)
- Attend 100% of kids' school events

**Now you have:** Focused goals (5/25) + Measurable outcomes (OKRs)

### Common Mistakes with 5/25

**1. The 20 become a "later" list**
- ❌ "I'll work on #6-25 after I do some top-5 work"
- ✅ "I will AVOID #6-25 until top 5 are COMPLETE"

**2. Not really ranking**
- ❌ "All 10 of these are equally important!" (then you haven't prioritized)
- ✅ "If I can only pick 5, gun to my head, which 5?" (force the choice)

**3. Picking "should" goals instead of "want" goals**
- ❌ "I should learn to code" (sounds good, but do you really want to?)
- ✅ "I genuinely want to get promoted" (aligned with values)

**4. Revisiting the list too often**
- ❌ Every month: "Let me swap #4 and #7"
- ✅ Annually or when a top-5 is complete: Then re-rank

**5. Applying to everything**
- ❌ 25 career goals AND 25 personal goals AND 25 health goals (now you have 75 things)
- ✅ 25 total across all life domains (or separate career list from personal, but each gets its own 5/25)

### When to Use 5/25

✅ **Use 5/25 when:**
- You feel scattered across too many goals
- You're a "yes" person who overcommits
- You need extreme focus (startup founder, major career push)
- You're failing to make progress on anything (trying to do everything)

❌ **Don't use 5/25 when:**
- You're in exploration mode (5/25 is for focus, not exploration)
- You need balance across domains (5/25 can be lopsided—e.g., all career, no health)
- Your goals are already clear and few

## Timeframe Stacking: Annual → Quarterly → Monthly → Weekly

Good goal-setting works across multiple timeframes.

**The hierarchy:**

```
    ANNUAL THEMES (1-3 themes)
           ↓
   ANNUAL GOALS (3-5 major goals)
           ↓
 QUARTERLY ROCKS (3-5 per quarter)
           ↓
  MONTHLY MILESTONES (3-5 per month)
           ↓
    WEEKLY WINS (3-5 per week)
           ↓
  DAILY NON-NEGOTIABLES (1-3 per day)
```

### Annual Themes

**Instead of (or in addition to) goals, choose 1-3 themes for the year.**

**Examples:**
- "Year of Health" (prioritize fitness, nutrition, sleep)
- "Year of Focus" (fewer commitments, deeper work)
- "Year of Building" (ship products, create content)
- "Year of Connection" (relationships, community, presence)
- "Year of Learning" (courses, skills, certifications)

**Why themes work:** They give you a lens for decision-making.

> "Should I join this committee?"
> → Check theme: Is this the "Year of Focus" or "Year of Networking"?
> → If "Year of Focus," the answer is no.

### Quarterly Rocks

**Rocks** = top 3-5 priorities for the quarter (from Traction/EOS framework)

**Why quarterly?**
- Annual is too long (priorities shift)
- Monthly is too short (can't accomplish meaningful work)
- **13 weeks is the sweet spot** (enough time to ship something, short enough to stay urgent)

**How to set Quarterly Rocks:**

**Step 1:** Review annual goals—which need focus this quarter?

**Step 2:** Pick 3-5 rocks (major priorities) for next 13 weeks

**Step 3:** For each rock, define what "done" looks like

**Example Q2 Rocks:**
1. Launch mobile app redesign (user testing complete, shipped to app stores, 10K downloads)
2. Hire 2 senior engineers (offers accepted, start dates set)
3. Hit $500K ARR (new sales + upsells)
4. Complete 10K race (race day: June 15)
5. Take 1 week vacation with family (zero work, dates: June 20-27)

### Monthly Milestones

**Each rock breaks into monthly milestones.**

**Example: "Launch mobile app redesign" rock**

**Month 1 (April):** Complete user testing (30 users), incorporate feedback, finalize designs
**Month 2 (May):** Engineering build (QA, bug fixes, performance testing)
**Month 3 (June):** Launch (App Store approval, marketing push, track downloads)

### Weekly Wins

**Each month breaks into weekly wins** (what do I need to accomplish THIS week?).

**Example: April Week 1 for mobile app**

**Weekly Win:** Recruit 10 users for testing, conduct 5 tests, synthesize feedback

**Daily tasks:**
- Monday: Recruit users (email list, post in community)
- Tuesday: Schedule tests (calendar invites, prep test script)
- Wednesday: Conduct 3 tests
- Thursday: Conduct 2 tests
- Friday: Synthesize feedback, share with design team

### Daily Non-Negotiables

**Every day, identify 1-3 non-negotiable tasks** that MUST get done.

Use Eisenhower Matrix or Ivy Lee Method (see other references).

**Example:**
1. Send final designs to engineering
2. Schedule 1-on-1 with new hire
3. Review pricing analysis for exec meeting

### How They Connect

**Annual goal:** Get promoted to Senior PM

**Q2 Rock:** Launch 2 major products

**April Milestone:** Complete mobile app user testing

**Week 1 Win:** Recruit and test with 10 users

**Monday Task:** Email 50 potential testers

**See the cascade?** Big goal → smaller goal → this quarter → this month → this week → today.

**This prevents:**
- ❌ Annual goals that never get worked on (no quarterly rocks)
- ❌ Busy days that don't move the needle (no link to weekly wins)
- ❌ Scattered effort (no daily non-negotiables)

## Balancing Personal and Professional Goals

**Common mistake:** Only setting work goals.

**Result:** Career success, personal life disaster.

**Better approach:** Balance across life domains.

### The Wheel of Life

**8 life domains:**
1. **Career** (professional growth, achievement)
2. **Finances** (savings, investments, debt)
3. **Health** (fitness, nutrition, sleep)
4. **Relationships** (romantic, family, friends)
5. **Personal Growth** (learning, hobbies, skills)
6. **Fun & Recreation** (joy, play, adventure)
7. **Physical Environment** (home, workspace, surroundings)
8. **Contribution** (giving back, impact, service)

**Rate each domain 1-10:** How satisfied are you?

**Set goals in the lowest-scoring domains.**

**Example:**
- Career: 8/10 (doing well)
- Health: 4/10 (neglected)
- Relationships: 5/10 (struggling)

**This year's focus:** Health + Relationships (let career coast at 8/10 while you bring up the 4s and 5s)

### Seasonal Prioritization

**You can't optimize all domains simultaneously.**

Some quarters/years emphasize one domain:
- **Q1:** Career focus (big launch, promotion push) → Health/relationships take back seat
- **Q2:** Family focus (summer vacation, kids off school) → Career coasts
- **Q3:** Back to career focus
- **Q4:** Balance/recovery

**This is intentional imbalance over time = balance overall.**

**Key:** Make it CONSCIOUS. Don't accidentally neglect a domain for 5 years.

---

## Goal Review and Adjustment

**Goals aren't set-and-forget.**

### Weekly Review (5-10 mins)

**Every week, review:**
- What are my top 3-5 goals (quarterly rocks)?
- Did I make progress this week?
- What's my focus for next week?

(See `13-weekly-review-process.md` for full process)

### Monthly Check-In (30 mins)

**Every month:**
- Review monthly milestones—on track?
- Review metrics (if you're tracking any)
- Adjust tactics if needed

**Questions:**
- What's working?
- What's not working?
- What should I start/stop/continue?

### Quarterly Retrospective (2 hours)

**End of each quarter:**
- Score OKRs (if using)
- Review quarterly rocks—what got done?
- Celebrate wins
- Analyze misses (why didn't it happen?)
- Set new quarterly rocks

### Annual Review (Full day)

**End of year:**
- Full year retrospective
- Review all goals—achievement %
- Wheel of Life assessment
- Values check-in (still aligned?)
- Set new annual goals + themes

(See `14-quarterly-annual-planning.md` for detailed process)

### When to Adjust Goals

**Adjust goals when:**
- **Context changed** (new job, new baby, health issue, market shift)
- **Goal became irrelevant** (wanted promotion, but realized you don't want management)
- **You're consistently missing** (goal was unrealistic)
- **You already achieved it** (great! Set a new goal)

**Don't adjust goals when:**
- It's hard (goals should be hard)
- You're bored (commitment beats motivation)
- You haven't given it enough time (some goals take 6+ months)

**Sunk cost fallacy:** Don't keep pursuing a goal just because you already invested time. If it's no longer aligned with your values, drop it.

## Summary: Values → Goals → Actions

**The full framework:**

1. **Clarify values** (see `01-values-clarification-foundation.md`)
2. **Set annual goals** aligned with values
3. **Break into quarterly rocks**
4. **Define monthly milestones**
5. **Plan weekly wins**
6. **Execute daily non-negotiables**
7. **Review weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually**
8. **Adjust as needed**

**Key principles:**

- **Values come first** (goals without values = climbing the wrong mountain)
- **Fewer goals = better results** (5/25 Rule)
- **SMART or OKRs** (pick the right framework for the goal type)
- **Balance domains** (career + health + relationships + growth)
- **Seasonal prioritization** (you can't optimize everything at once)
- **Review regularly** (goals drift without check-ins)
- **Adjust when needed** (context changes; goals should too)

## Next Steps

**Now that you understand goal-setting frameworks:**

1. **Set 3-5 SMART goals OR OKRs** for this quarter
2. **Use 5/25 Rule** to eliminate distractions
3. **Set up review cadence** (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
4. **Balance personal + professional** (use Wheel of Life)
5. **Link goals to daily work** (timeframe stacking)
