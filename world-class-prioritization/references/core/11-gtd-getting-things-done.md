# Getting Things Done (GTD)

*"Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them." — David Allen*

## The Problem: Mental Overload

**Your brain right now:**
- "Don't forget to email Sarah"
- "Need to buy groceries"
- "That project deadline is coming up"
- "Oh, I should schedule that dentist appointment"
- "Wait, what was I just working on?"

**The cost:**
- **Cognitive load:** Your brain is using RAM to store reminders
- **Anxiety:** Constant fear you're forgetting something
- **Reduced focus:** Can't be present because you're mentally tracking 50 things
- **Decision paralysis:** Looking at your todo list overwhelms you

**David Allen's insight:** Your brain is terrible at remembering things, but excellent at processing them.

**The solution:** Get everything OUT of your head and INTO a trusted system.

## GTD Overview

**Getting Things Done (GTD) = A complete workflow for managing commitments**

**Five steps:**
1. **Capture:** Get everything out of your head
2. **Clarify:** Process what each thing means
3. **Organize:** Put it where it belongs
4. **Reflect:** Review regularly (weekly review)
5. **Engage:** Do the work

**The promise:** Once you trust your system, your mind is free to focus on the work at hand (not tracking what needs to be done).

## Step 1: Capture (Collect Everything)

**The rule:** Capture 100% of everything that has your attention.

### What to Capture

**Everything that's on your mind:**
- Tasks ("Call plumber")
- Projects ("Launch new website")
- Ideas ("Blog post about X")
- Commitments ("Promised John I'd review his doc")
- Errands ("Buy batteries")
- Things to read ("That article Sarah sent")
- Things to watch ("Conference talk on YouTube")

**If it's in your head, it's NOT in your system.**

### Capture Tools

**You need:**

**1. Ubiquitous capture tool** (always with you)
- Phone notes app
- Physical notebook
- Voice recorder

**Rule:** ONE capture tool you always have. No hunting for the "right" place.

**2. Inbox (physical)**
- Tray on desk for paper
- All paper goes here

**3. Inbox (digital)**
- Email inbox
- Note-taking app (Notion, Evernote, Apple Notes)

**Throughout the day:**
- Thought pops up → capture it → move on
- Email arrives → stays in inbox (for now)
- Someone asks you to do something → capture it

**The habit:** Capture immediately. Don't trust your memory.

### The Mind Sweep Exercise

**Do this now (20-30 minutes):**

**Get a blank document. Write down EVERYTHING on your mind:**

**Prompts:**
- What tasks do you need to do?
- What have you committed to?
- What's bothering you?
- What are you worried about forgetting?
- What do you want to do someday?
- What needs to be fixed/bought/scheduled?
- What conversations do you need to have?
- What decisions are you avoiding?

**Keep writing until you can't think of anything else.**

**Result:** 50-150 items. That's what your brain has been tracking. No wonder you're anxious.

**Now you have everything captured. Next step: Clarify.**

## Step 2: Clarify (Process What It Means)

**Clarifying = Processing each item to determine what it is and what to do about it.**

### The Clarifying Questions

**For each item in your inbox, ask:**

**Q1: What is it?**

**Q2: Is it actionable?**

**If NO:**
- **Trash:** Not important → Delete
- **Someday/Maybe:** Not now, but maybe later → Move to Someday/Maybe list
- **Reference:** Information to keep → File in reference system

**If YES → Q3:**

**Q3: What's the next action?**

**Critical rule:** Define the VERY NEXT PHYSICAL ACTION.

**❌ Vague:** "Website redesign"
**✅ Specific:** "Email design agency for quote"

**❌ Vague:** "Plan vacation"
**✅ Specific:** "Search flights to Hawaii for July"

**If it takes <2 minutes → Do it now** (2-minute rule)

**If it takes >2 minutes:**

**Q4: Is it a single action or a project?**

**Single action:** One step, then done
- "Reply to John's email"
- "Schedule dentist appointment"
→ Goes to **Next Actions list**

**Project:** Requires multiple steps
- "Launch new website"
- "Hire new PM"
- "Plan vacation"
→ Goes to **Projects list** + define next action

**Q5: Can someone else do it?**
- **Yes:** → **Waiting For list** (you delegate, track follow-up)
- **No:** → **Next Actions list**

**Q6: Does it need to happen at a specific time?**
- **Yes:** → **Calendar**
- **No:** → **Next Actions list**

### The Clarifying Flowchart

```
Item in inbox
    ↓
Is it actionable?
    ↓ NO → Trash / Someday/Maybe / Reference
    ↓ YES
    ↓
What's the next action?
    ↓
<2 minutes?
    ↓ YES → DO IT NOW
    ↓ NO
    ↓
Single action or project?
    ↓ Single Action → Next Actions list
    ↓ Project → Projects list + Next Actions list
    ↓
Delegate?
    ↓ YES → Waiting For list
    ↓ NO
    ↓
Specific time?
    ↓ YES → Calendar
    ↓ NO → Next Actions list
```

### Examples of Clarifying

**Item:** "Website redesign"

**Processing:**
- Actionable? Yes
- Next action? "Email design agency for quote"
- <2 min? No
- Project or action? Project (multiple steps)
- Add to Projects list: "Website Redesign"
- Add to Next Actions: "Email design agency for quote"
- Context: @Computer

**Item:** "That article Sarah sent"

**Processing:**
- Actionable? Depends. Do I WANT to read it?
- If yes: Next action = "Read article from Sarah" → Add to Next Actions (@Read)
- If no: Trash
- If maybe: Someday/Maybe list

**Item:** "Buy groceries"

**Processing:**
- Actionable? Yes
- Next action? "Buy: milk, eggs, bread"
- <2 min? No (requires a trip)
- Project or action? Single action
- Add to Next Actions (@Errands)

**The key: Process to empty inbox. Don't leave items in inbox.**

## Step 3: Organize (Put It Where It Belongs)

**After clarifying, everything goes into one of these lists/places:**

### The Core Lists

**1. Next Actions**
- Single-step tasks you can do
- Organized by context (see below)

**2. Projects**
- Multi-step outcomes
- Each project has at least one next action

**3. Waiting For**
- Tasks you delegated
- Waiting for responses/deliverables

**4. Calendar**
- Time-specific commitments only
- Meetings, deadlines, appointments

**5. Someday/Maybe**
- Things you might want to do, but not now
- Review quarterly

**6. Reference**
- Information you need to keep
- Files, notes, documents

### Contexts: Organizing Next Actions

**Problem:** You have 50 next actions. How do you choose what to do now?

**Solution:** Organize by CONTEXT (where/when/with whom you can do the task)

**Common contexts:**

**@Computer:** Tasks requiring computer
- "Update quarterly report"
- "Email design agency"
- "Review pull requests"

**@Phone:** Calls to make
- "Call dentist to schedule"
- "Call John about project"

**@Office:** Tasks requiring office
- "Print documents"
- "Talk to Sarah about budget"

**@Errands:** Tasks outside office
- "Buy groceries"
- "Pick up dry cleaning"
- "Drop off package at post office"

**@Home:** Home-specific tasks
- "Fix leaky faucet"
- "Organize garage"

**@Waiting:** Waiting for someone else
- "Waiting for John's feedback on proposal"
- "Waiting for design agency quote"

**@Read:** Reading list
- "Read article Sarah sent"
- "Read product spec"

**@Agenda [Person]:** Topics to discuss with specific people
- "@Agenda Sarah: Discuss Q3 roadmap"
- "@Agenda Boss: Request time off"

**Why contexts work:**
- You're at your computer → Filter to @Computer tasks
- You're running errands → Filter to @Errands
- You're with Sarah → Check @Agenda Sarah list

**You only see tasks you CAN do right now.**

### Projects List Structure

**Projects list = Outcomes requiring >1 action**

**Format:**
- Project name (desired outcome)
- Next action (what moves it forward)
- Status (active, on hold, planning)

**Example Projects list:**

| Project | Next Action | Status |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Launch new website | Email design agency for quote | Active |
| Hire new PM | Review resumes in inbox | Active |
| Q3 OKR planning | Schedule planning meeting | Active |
| Home office setup | Research standing desks | On hold |

**Rule:** Every project must have a next action. If it doesn't, it's stalled.

### Weekly Review (Critical)

**GTD lives or dies on the weekly review.**

**Without weekly review:** Your system becomes stale, you stop trusting it, back to mental overload.

**With weekly review:** Your system stays current, you trust it, mental clarity.

**See `13-weekly-review-process.md` for full weekly review.**

## Step 4: Reflect (Review the System)

**Reflection happens at two levels:**

### Daily Review (5 minutes)

**Every morning:**
1. Check calendar (what's time-specific today?)
2. Review Next Actions list (what can I do today?)
3. Choose 2-3 Most Important Tasks (MITs) for today

**Every evening:**
1. Empty physical inbox (process papers)
2. Empty digital inbox (process emails to <10)
3. Update Next Actions based on what happened
4. Plan tomorrow

### Weekly Review (60-90 minutes)

**Every Friday (or your chosen day):**

**1. Get Clear (empty inboxes)**
- Process email inbox to zero
- Process notes app/capture tool to zero
- Process physical inbox to zero

**2. Get Current (review lists)**
- Review Calendar (past week + next 2 weeks)
- Review Next Actions (any completed? any new?)
- Review Projects (is each project moving? next actions defined?)
- Review Waiting For (follow up on anything?)

**3. Get Creative (look ahead)**
- Review Someday/Maybe (anything to activate?)
- Brainstorm new ideas
- Big picture thinking

**Full process in `13-weekly-review-process.md`**

## Step 5: Engage (Do the Work)

**You've captured, clarified, organized, reflected. Now: Work.**

### Choosing What to Do (The 4 Criteria)

**When deciding what to work on, consider:**

**1. Context:** What can I do RIGHT NOW?
- At computer → @Computer list
- Have 30 minutes → @Quick Wins
- With Sarah → @Agenda Sarah

**2. Time available:** How much time do I have?
- 5 minutes → Email responses
- 2 hours → Deep work on project

**3. Energy available:** How much energy do I have?
- High energy → Strategic work (see `09-energy-management-chronotypes.md`)
- Low energy → Admin tasks

**4. Priority:** What's most important?
- Use Eisenhower Matrix (see `10-eisenhower-matrix-daily-planning.md`)
- Focus on Q2 work (important, not urgent)

### The GTD Decision Tree for Engagement

**Standing at your desk, asking "What should I do now?"**

**Step 1:** Check calendar
- Any time-specific commitments? Do those first.

**Step 2:** Check context
- Where am I? What tools do I have? → Filter Next Actions by context

**Step 3:** Check time available
- 15 minutes until meeting? → Quick actions only
- 3 hours of open time? → Deep work on project

**Step 4:** Check energy level
- High energy? → Most important project work
- Low energy? → Admin, email, easy tasks

**Step 5:** Choose from filtered list
- You're now looking at 5-10 actions (not 50)
- Pick the most important one
- Do it

**The magic:** You're not overwhelmed by the full list. You're seeing ONLY what you can do right now.

## GTD for Different Roles

### GTD for Knowledge Workers

**Typical contexts:**
- @Computer
- @Email
- @Calls
- @Meetings
- @Read
- @Waiting

**Typical projects:**
- Product launches
- Strategy documents
- Hiring processes
- OKR planning

**Integration:**
- Use time blocking for deep work projects (see `08-time-blocking-deep-work.md`)
- Weekly review on Friday afternoons
- Daily review each morning

### GTD for Managers

**Additional contexts:**
- @Agenda [Each direct report]
- @Team (discuss in team meeting)
- @Strategic (high-level thinking time)

**Typical projects:**
- Team OKRs
- Performance reviews
- Hiring
- Process improvements

**Manager-specific tip:**
- Keep @Agenda lists for each direct report
- During 1-on-1s, go through agenda
- Capture new items during 1-on-1s

### GTD for Entrepreneurs

**Additional contexts:**
- @Marketing
- @Sales
- @Product
- @Operations

**Typical projects:**
- Product launches
- Fundraising
- Hiring
- Business development

**Entrepreneur-specific tip:**
- Separate personal and professional inboxes
- Use Someday/Maybe extensively (so many ideas!)
- Weekly review is CRITICAL (easy to get pulled in 10 directions)

## Common GTD Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not Capturing Everything

**Problem:** Still keeping some things in your head
- "I'll remember to do that"
- Spoiler: You won't

**Fix:** Carry capture tool everywhere. Develop capture habit.

### Mistake 2: Vague Next Actions

**Problem:** Next action is unclear
- "Website redesign" (not actionable)
- "Think about strategy" (not actionable)

**Fix:** Define the VERY NEXT PHYSICAL ACTION
- "Email design agency for quote"
- "Write 3 potential strategy directions"

### Mistake 3: Skipping Weekly Review

**Problem:** Your system gets stale
- Old items pile up
- You stop trusting it
- Back to mental overload

**Fix:** Non-negotiable weekly review. Block 90 minutes every Friday.

### Mistake 4: Calendar as Todo List

**Problem:** Putting non-time-specific tasks on calendar
- "Work on strategy doc" at 2pm (but it's flexible)

**Fix:** Calendar = only time-specific commitments. Everything else = Next Actions list.

**Why:** Your calendar should be sacred. If it's on there, it's a real commitment.

### Mistake 5: Too Many Lists

**Problem:** 50 different lists
- "Work tasks"
- "Personal tasks"
- "Urgent"
- "Important"
- "This week"
- Etc.

**Fix:** Stick to GTD core lists (Next Actions, Projects, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe). Use contexts within Next Actions.

### Mistake 6: Not Defining Next Actions for Projects

**Problem:** Projects list has no next actions
- Result: Projects stall

**Fix:** Every project MUST have a defined next action. If it doesn't, it's not moving.

## Tools for GTD

**GTD is tool-agnostic. Use whatever works for you.**

### Digital Tools

**Simple:**
- Apple Reminders (contexts via lists)
- Google Tasks
- Todoist (has context support)

**Advanced:**
- Things 3 (Mac/iOS, built for GTD)
- OmniFocus (Mac/iOS, most powerful GTD app)
- Notion (flexible, can build custom GTD)

**Email-based:**
- Gmail + labels (contexts as labels)
- Outlook + folders

**Recommendations:**
- **Beginners:** Todoist or Apple Reminders
- **Advanced:** Things 3 or OmniFocus
- **Customizers:** Notion

### Analog Tools

**Paper-based GTD works great:**
- Bullet journal
- Index cards (one per task)
- Simple notebook

**Format:**
- Page 1: Next Actions (@Computer)
- Page 2: Next Actions (@Calls)
- Page 3: Projects
- Etc.

**Advantage of analog:** No digital distractions. Very tactile.

## Inbox Zero

**Inbox zero = Part of GTD (processing inboxes to empty)**

**The myth:** Inbox zero means responding to every email immediately.

**The reality:** Inbox zero means processing every email (decide what it means, then move it out of inbox).

### The Email Processing Workflow

**Open email, ask:**

**1. Is this actionable?**

**NO:**
- Delete (most email)
- Archive (reference)
- Unsubscribe (newsletters you don't read)

**YES → 2. What's the next action?**

**<2 minutes to respond?**
→ Respond now, archive

**>2 minutes?**
→ Add to Next Actions list (@Email or @Computer), archive email

**Requires someone else?**
→ Forward/delegate, add to Waiting For list, archive

**FYI only?**
→ Read, archive

**Takes 30+ minutes?**
→ It's a project. Add to Projects list, define next action, archive email

**Result:** Email inbox goes to zero. All actions are in your GTD system.

**Process email 2-3x per day** (not constantly):
- Morning: 8-9am
- Midday: 12-1pm
- End of day: 4-5pm

**See `08-time-blocking-deep-work.md` for email batching strategy**

## The Two-Minute Rule

**If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately (don't add to list).**

**Examples:**
- Reply to quick email
- File a document
- Make a quick phone call
- Send a Slack message

**Why:** It takes longer to capture, clarify, organize, and review a 2-minute task than to just do it.

**Exception:** If you're in deep work (see `08-time-blocking-deep-work.md`), don't interrupt yourself for 2-minute tasks. Capture them, do them during shallow work time.

## GTD + Other Frameworks

**GTD complements other prioritization frameworks:**

**GTD + Eisenhower Matrix:**
- GTD captures and organizes everything
- Eisenhower helps you prioritize what to do first
- Q2 (Important/Not Urgent) = Your most important projects
- See `10-eisenhower-matrix-daily-planning.md`

**GTD + Time Blocking:**
- GTD gives you the list of what to do
- Time blocking gives you WHEN to do it
- Block calendar time for important projects
- See `08-time-blocking-deep-work.md`

**GTD + Weekly Review:**
- GTD's weekly review is the foundation
- Add reflection questions for bigger picture
- See `13-weekly-review-process.md`

**GTD + Energy Management:**
- GTD tells you WHAT to do
- Chronotypes tell you WHEN (based on energy)
- Schedule high-energy tasks during Biological Prime Time
- See `09-energy-management-chronotypes.md`

## Getting Started with GTD

**Week 1: Initial setup (3-4 hours)**

**Day 1: Mind sweep (1 hour)**
- Capture everything on your mind (use prompts above)
- Goal: 100+ items captured

**Day 2: Process inboxes (2 hours)**
- Email inbox to zero
- Physical inbox to zero
- Clarify and organize everything

**Day 3: Set up lists (30 mins)**
- Create core lists (Next Actions, Projects, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe)
- Choose your tool (digital or analog)
- Set up contexts

**Day 4: Daily practice (15 mins/day)**
- Morning review
- Capture throughout day
- Evening review

**Week 2-4: Build habits**
- Continue daily reviews
- Do first weekly review (end of Week 1)
- Refine contexts as needed
- Adjust tool/system if not working

**Month 2: Trust the system**
- By now, your mind should feel clearer
- You trust the system to remember for you
- Weekly review is a habit
- You feel less anxious

## Summary: Clear Mind, Clear Focus

**Key principles:**
1. **Capture everything** (brain for thinking, not storing)
2. **Clarify what it means** (next action?)
3. **Organize by context** (only see what you can do now)
4. **Review weekly** (keep system current)
5. **Engage with confidence** (trust your system)

**The GTD promise:**
- Mind like water (calm, responsive, not overwhelmed)
- No more anxiety about forgetting things
- Present in the moment (not mentally tracking 50 tasks)
- Doing the right work at the right time

**GTD is the operating system for your commitments.**
