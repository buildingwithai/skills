# Decision-Making Frameworks

*When you face tough choices between competing priorities, you need mental models that help you think clearly. These frameworks cut through uncertainty and reveal what really matters.*

## Why Decision-Making Frameworks Matter for Prioritization

**Every prioritization is a decision:**
- Should I do X or Y?
- Which opportunity should I pursue?
- What should I say no to?
- Is this worth my time?

**Without frameworks, you rely on:**
- ❌ Gut feel (inconsistent, biased)
- ❌ What feels urgent (not what's important)
- ❌ What others want (not what you value)
- ❌ What's easiest (not what matters most)

**With frameworks, you have:**
- ✅ Systematic thinking (repeatable, clear)
- ✅ Explicit trade-offs (see what you're giving up)
- ✅ Values alignment (choose what matters)
- ✅ Confidence (know you made the right call)

**This guide covers three powerful frameworks:**

1. **Opportunity Cost Analysis** - What are you giving up?
2. **First Principles Thinking** - What's actually true?
3. **Regret Minimization Framework** - What will you regret?

---

## Framework 1: Opportunity Cost Analysis

**Best for:** Resource allocation decisions, time management, any choice between alternatives

### What It Is

**Opportunity cost** = The value of the next best alternative you give up when you make a choice.

**Every decision has an opportunity cost.**

When you say YES to one thing, you're saying NO to everything else you could have done with that time/money/energy.

### Why It Matters

**Most people only think about what they're gaining.**

They don't think about what they're losing (the opportunity cost).

**Example:**

**Decision:** Take a VP job at a startup

**What you see:**
- ✅ Big title
- ✅ Equity upside
- ✅ More responsibility

**What you don't see (opportunity cost):**
- ❌ No time for side project you've been building
- ❌ 60-hour weeks = miss family time
- ❌ High-stress role = less time for health
- ❌ Startup risk = could fail and you wasted 2 years

**If you only look at gains, you take the job.**

**If you include opportunity cost, you might realize:** "The equity upside isn't worth sacrificing my side project, family time, and health."

### How to Use Opportunity Cost Analysis

**Step 1: Define the decision**

What are you choosing between?

Examples:
- Take Job A or Job B?
- Work on Project X or Project Y?
- Spend Saturday with family or work on side project?
- Invest in Stock A or Real Estate?

**Step 2: List what you GAIN from each option**

**Option A (Take VP job):**
- Title: Vice President
- Salary: $250K + equity
- Experience: Leading 20-person team
- Network: Access to investors, execs

**Option B (Stay as Senior PM):**
- Keep current work-life balance
- Continue side project (3 hours/week)
- Flexibility to leave at 5pm
- Lower stress

**Step 3: List what you LOSE from each option (opportunity cost)**

**If you choose Option A (VP job), you LOSE:**
- Side project progress (no time for 3 hrs/week = 150 hrs/year)
- Family time (60-hr weeks vs. current 40)
- Health (stress, less exercise, worse sleep)
- Optionality (locked in for 2+ years due to vesting)

**If you choose Option B (Stay Senior PM), you LOSE:**
- Title/prestige (VP looks better on resume)
- Equity upside (could be worth millions)
- Leadership experience (managing 20 vs. managing 5)
- Network/visibility

**Step 4: Compare total value (gains - losses)**

**Option A net value:**
- Gains: Title, $$$, experience
- Losses: Time, health, side project, family
- **Net:** High financial upside, low personal upside

**Option B net value:**
- Gains: Balance, side project, health, family
- Losses: Career advancement, money, network
- **Net:** Low financial upside, high personal upside

**Step 5: Align with values**

**If your values are:** Achievement, wealth-building, career growth
→ **Choose Option A** (aligns with values, opportunity cost is acceptable)

**If your values are:** Family, health, autonomy, side projects
→ **Choose Option B** (aligns with values, opportunity cost of Option A is too high)

**There's no "right" answer—only the right answer FOR YOU based on YOUR values.**

### Opportunity Cost Questions to Ask

**For any decision, ask:**

1. **"If I say yes to this, what am I saying no to?"**
   - What else could I do with this time/money/energy?

2. **"What's the next best alternative?"**
   - If not this, what would I do instead?

3. **"What am I giving up that I can't get back?"**
   - Time is non-renewable; money is renewable
   - Relationships, health, experiences = harder to get back

4. **"Is this the best use of this resource?"**
   - Is this the highest-value thing I could do with my Saturday?
   - Is this the best investment for $10K?

5. **"What would have to be true for the opportunity cost to be worth it?"**
   - "I'd take the 60-hr/week job IF the equity was worth $5M+ and I only had to do it for 2 years"

### Common Opportunity Cost Mistakes

**1. Sunk Cost Fallacy**

**Mistake:** "I've already spent 6 months on this project. I can't quit now."

**Opportunity cost reality:** The 6 months are gone (sunk cost). The question is: What's the best use of the NEXT 6 months?

**Fix:** Ignore sunk costs. Only consider future opportunity costs.

**2. Ignoring Time Opportunity Cost**

**Mistake:** "This is free!" (free webinar, free event, free opportunity)

**Opportunity cost reality:** It's not free—it costs TIME. What else could you do with those 2 hours?

**Fix:** Always ask: "What's the opportunity cost of my time?"

**3. Only Comparing Monetary Costs**

**Mistake:** "Job A pays $10K more, so it's better."

**Opportunity cost reality:** But Job A requires 20 more hours/week. What's the opportunity cost of those hours? (Family time? Health? Side project?)

**Fix:** Compare ALL costs (money, time, energy, stress, relationships).

**4. Short-Term Thinking**

**Mistake:** "I'll work 80-hour weeks now and relax later."

**Opportunity cost reality:** Later never comes. And you can't get back your 30s, your kids' childhoods, or your health.

**Fix:** Consider long-term opportunity costs (what you're sacrificing over years, not just weeks).

### Opportunity Cost in Daily Prioritization

**Use opportunity cost for everyday decisions:**

**Meeting request:**
- Cost: 1 hour
- Opportunity cost: What else could I do with that hour? (Deep work on launch, 1-on-1 with report, exercise)
- Decision: Is this meeting more valuable than deep work? Usually no → Decline.

**Side project invitation:**
- Cost: 5 hours/week
- Opportunity cost: Time with family, working on my own side project, sleep
- Decision: Is this more valuable than family time? No → Decline.

**Course purchase:**
- Cost: $500 + 20 hours
- Opportunity cost: $500 could go to savings; 20 hours could go to shipping product
- Decision: Will this course create >$500 value or advance my career more than shipping product? Maybe → Conditional yes.

**Template for quick decisions:**

> "If I do [X], I can't do [Y]. Which is more valuable given my current values and goals?"

---

## Framework 2: First Principles Thinking

**Best for:** Challenging assumptions, strategic pivots, questioning the status quo, complex problems

### What It Is

**First principles thinking** = Breaking down a problem to its fundamental truths and reasoning up from there, rather than reasoning by analogy.

**Reasoning by analogy:**
> "Everyone does it this way, so I should too."
> "This worked before, so I'll do it again."
> "Industry standard is X, so X must be right."

**Reasoning from first principles:**
> "What's actually true? What are the fundamental constraints? If I started from scratch, what would I do?"

### Why It Matters for Prioritization

**Most people prioritize based on assumptions:**
- "This is how we've always done it"
- "This is what PMs are supposed to focus on"
- "Everyone says I should want a promotion"

**First principles thinking challenges those assumptions:**
- "Should we actually do it this way?"
- "What should I ACTUALLY focus on?"
- "Do I actually want a promotion, or do I just think I should?"

**It reveals priorities you didn't know you had (or shouldn't have).**

### How to Use First Principles Thinking

**Step 1: Identify your assumptions**

**Example decision:** "Should I get an MBA?"

**Assumptions lurking:**
- "I need an MBA to advance my career"
- "MBA = more money"
- "Everyone at my level has an MBA"
- "Good PMs have MBAs"

**Step 2: Break down to fundamental truths**

**Question each assumption:** "Is this actually true? Or just conventional wisdom?"

**Assumption:** "I need an MBA to advance my career"

**First principles question:**
- What do I actually need to advance? (Skills? Network? Credentials? Track record?)
- Do I need an MBA for those things? Or are there other paths?

**Fundamental truth:** "I need demonstrated leadership, strategic thinking, and a strong network to get promoted."

**Question:** "Does MBA provide that? Or could I get it elsewhere?"

**Assumption:** "MBA = more money"

**First principles question:**
- Does the data support this? (What's the actual ROI of MBA?)
- For MY situation, will it increase earnings?

**Fundamental truth:** "Average MBA ROI is +$X, but it varies widely by school, industry, and role. For product managers specifically, track record matters more than degree."

**Step 3: Reason up from fundamentals**

**Fundamental truth #1:** I need leadership experience, strategic thinking, network

**Fundamental truth #2:** MBA costs $200K + 2 years opportunity cost

**Fundamental truth #3:** I can gain leadership by managing bigger teams at work, strategic thinking through exec courses ($10K), network through PM communities

**Conclusion:** "I don't actually need an MBA. I can get what I need for 1/20th the cost and time."

**This is first principles thinking:** Questioning conventional path, finding truth, reasoning up from there.

### Example: Elon Musk & Battery Costs

**Conventional wisdom (reasoning by analogy):**
> "Batteries are expensive. They cost $600/kWh. They've always been expensive. They'll always be expensive."

**Elon Musk (first principles):**
> "What are batteries made of? Cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, some polymers. What's the spot price of those materials on the commodities market? $80/kWh."
>
> "If the materials cost $80, why do batteries cost $600? Because of manufacturing, overhead, margin, inefficiency."
>
> "If we buy materials at commodity prices and manufacture at scale, we can get to $100-150/kWh."

**Result:** Tesla drove battery costs from $600/kWh down to ~$100/kWh, making EVs economically viable.

**That's first principles:** Break down to fundamental truth (material cost), reason up (how to manufacture efficiently), question assumption (batteries must be expensive).

### First Principles for Career Decisions

**Question:** "Should I try to become a VP?"

**Conventional wisdom:**
- "Career path is IC → Manager → Director → VP"
- "More senior = better"
- "I should want to climb the ladder"

**First principles questions:**
- "What do I actually enjoy? Deep work on product or managing people?"
- "What are my core values? Mastery and autonomy, or leadership and organizational impact?"
- "What's the fundamental trade-off? VP = meetings + politics + people management. Do I want that?"

**Fundamental truth:**
- "I value deep product work, autonomy, and work-life balance."
- "VP role = 80% meetings, high politics, 60-hour weeks."
- "This is fundamentally misaligned with my values."

**Conclusion:** "I don't actually want to be a VP. I want to stay IC or become a Staff/Principal PM (deep product work at scale). Conventional career path doesn't apply to me."

**First principles revealed:** The "right" path for you, not society's default path.

### First Principles Questions for Prioritization

**When facing a decision, ask:**

1. **"What's actually true here?"**
   - Strip away assumptions, conventional wisdom, "should"
   - Get to bedrock truth

2. **"What are the fundamental constraints?"**
   - Time, money, energy, skills—what's non-negotiable?

3. **"If I started from scratch, what would I do?"**
   - Remove history, sunk costs, "how we've always done it"

4. **"Why do I believe this?"**
   - Is it because everyone says so? Or because I've validated it?

5. **"What would have to be true for this to be the wrong choice?"**
   - Inversion: Assume you're wrong. What evidence would prove it?

### First Principles for Product Prioritization

**Conventional wisdom:** "We should build feature X because competitor has it."

**First principles:**
- "Why does competitor have it? Because their customers value Y."
- "Do OUR customers value Y? Let's ask."
- [Survey customers]
- "Actually, our customers value Z, not Y."
- "We should build for Z, not copy competitor's X."

**Conventional wisdom:** "We need to ship fast. Cut quality to hit deadline."

**First principles:**
- "Why ship fast? To learn or to hit arbitrary date?"
- "If to learn, minimum viable means USABLE, not broken."
- "If to hit date, why that date? Who chose it? Is it real or made up?"
- "Fundamental truth: Shipping broken product creates more work (support, fixes, churn) than shipping good product a week later."

**Conclusion:** "Ship when ready, not when arbitrary date says so."

### When to Use First Principles

✅ **Use first principles when:**
- You're questioning a major assumption
- Conventional wisdom doesn't make sense
- You're considering a big strategic change
- Everyone says "that's just how it's done" (red flag!)
- You feel stuck in a pattern that doesn't work

❌ **Don't use first principles when:**
- It's a small, low-stakes decision (overthinking)
- Conventional wisdom is actually right (don't reinvent the wheel)
- You need to move fast (first principles is slow, deep thinking)

**First principles is a power tool. Use it for big questions, not daily tasks.**

## Framework 3: Regret Minimization Framework

**Best for:** Big life decisions, career changes, risk-taking, long-term thinking

### What It Is

**Regret minimization** = Making decisions based on what you'll regret LEAST when you're old.

**The core question:**
> "When I'm 80 years old, which choice will I regret more?"

**This shifts perspective:**
- From short-term fears → long-term regret
- From "what if I fail?" → "what if I never try?"
- From safety → fulfillment

### The Jeff Bezos Story

**Context:** 1994, Jeff Bezos is 30, working at a hedge fund (D.E. Shaw), getting big bonuses, recently married.

**Decision:** Stay at hedge fund (safe, lucrative) or quit to start an online bookstore called Amazon (risky, uncertain).

**His thinking process (regret minimization):**

> "I knew that when I was 80, I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed, I wouldn't regret that."
>
> "But I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that would haunt me every day."

**The question wasn't:** "Will Amazon succeed?"

**The question was:** "Will I regret not trying?"

**Answer:** "Yes, I'd regret not trying. I won't regret trying and failing."

**Decision:** Quit. Start Amazon.

**Result:** Well, we know how that turned out.

### How to Use Regret Minimization Framework

**Step 1: Define the decision**

**Example:** "Should I leave my stable corporate job to start a company?"

**Step 2: Project to age 80**

**Imagine yourself at 80 years old, looking back on your life.**

You're sitting on a porch, reflecting. What matters? What doesn't?

**Step 3: Consider both paths**

**Path A: Stay at corporate job**

At 80, looking back:
- "I had a stable career, good salary, predictable life."
- "I always wondered what would have happened if I'd started that company."
- "I played it safe. I wonder if I could have done something bigger."
- "I regret not taking the risk when I had the chance."

**Path B: Start the company**

At 80, looking back:
- "I tried. I gave it everything. It failed after 2 years."
- "But I don't regret trying. I learned so much. It was an adventure."
- "At least I know. I don't have to wonder 'what if?'"

Or:
- "I tried. It worked. I built something meaningful. I'm proud."

**Step 4: Ask the key question**

> "Which path will I regret MORE?"

**Path A (stay):** High regret risk (wondering "what if?")

**Path B (try):** Low regret risk (at least I tried)

**Decision:** Start the company (minimize regret).

### Why This Framework Works

**Regret minimization removes short-term noise:**

**Short-term thinking:**
- "What if I fail?"
- "What will people think?"
- "I'll lose my salary."
- "It's scary."

**Long-term thinking (80 years old):**
- "Did I try?"
- "Did I live fully?"
- "Did I follow my values?"
- "Did I avoid wondering 'what if?'"

**At 80, you won't care about:**
- That one quarter's salary you gave up
- What your friends thought in 2025
- The fear you felt

**At 80, you WILL care about:**
- Whether you tried
- Whether you followed your values
- Whether you lived with courage

### Regret Minimization for Smaller Decisions

**You don't need to save it for starting a company.**

**Use it for:**
- Career changes
- Relationship decisions
- Moving to a new city
- Learning a new skill
- Taking a sabbatical
- Saying no to obligations

**Example: Side project**

**Decision:** "Should I spend 10 hours/week on this side project for the next year?"

**Regret test:**
- Path A (do it): "I built something. Maybe it worked, maybe it didn't. But I tried."
- Path B (don't do it): "I always wondered if it could have worked. I chose Netflix over building."

**At 80:** Path B = higher regret.

**Decision:** Do the side project.

**Example: Saying no to committee**

**Decision:** "Should I join the board of this nonprofit?"

**Regret test:**
- Path A (join): "I gave 10 hours/month for 3 years. It was fine. But it took time from my family and my own projects."
- Path B (don't join): "I focused on my family and my work. I don't regret not joining someone else's committee."

**At 80:** Path A = higher regret (time with family is irreplaceable).

**Decision:** Say no.

### Combining Regret Minimization with Values

**Regret minimization works BEST when you've clarified your values** (see `01-values-clarification-foundation.md`).

**If your values are:** Courage, impact, risk-taking
→ You'll regret NOT taking risks

**If your values are:** Family, stability, presence
→ You'll regret sacrificing family for work

**The framework is personal. What YOU'LL regret depends on YOUR values.**

### Common Regrets (Research-Backed)

**Bronnie Ware**, a palliative care nurse, documented the top 5 regrets of the dying:

1. **"I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."**
   - Translation: Regret living by "should" instead of values

2. **"I wish I hadn't worked so hard."**
   - Translation: Regret sacrificing family/health for career

3. **"I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings."**
   - Translation: Regret not being authentic, not having hard conversations

4. **"I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends."**
   - Translation: Regret letting relationships fade

5. **"I wish I had let myself be happier."**
   - Translation: Regret worrying about small things instead of enjoying life

**Notice:** NOT on the list:
- "I wish I'd made VP"
- "I wish I'd worked harder"
- "I wish I'd made more money"

**The framework predicts:** You won't regret trying and failing. You'll regret not trying.

### When to Use Regret Minimization

✅ **Use regret minimization when:**
- You're facing a big, uncertain decision
- Risk is high but so is potential reward
- Short-term costs are real but long-term regret is possible
- You're stuck between "safe" and "meaningful"
- Fear is holding you back from something important

❌ **Don't use regret minimization when:**
- The decision is reversible (you can change your mind later)
- Long-term doesn't matter (choosing lunch: who cares at 80?)
- You're using it to justify reckless decisions (regret minimization ≠ YOLO)

### Regret Minimization Questions

**When facing a decision, ask:**

1. **"At 80 years old, will I regret not doing this?"**
   - If yes → Strong signal to do it
   - If no → Strong signal to skip it

2. **"Will I regret DOING this?"**
   - Some decisions you regret taking (e.g., betraying values for money)

3. **"What's the worst that could happen if I try?"**
   - Usually: Temporary embarrassment, financial setback, time lost
   - Rarely: Permanent damage

4. **"What's the worst that could happen if I DON'T try?"**
   - Usually: Lifelong wonder "what if?"
   - Often: Permanent regret

5. **"Which regret is easier to live with?"**
   - Regret of action (tried and failed) → Easier
   - Regret of inaction (never tried) → Harder

### Regret Minimization for Work-Life Balance

**Common decision:** "Should I work this weekend to hit the deadline?"

**Short-term thinking:** "Yes, the deadline is important."

**Regret minimization:** "At 80, will I remember this deadline? Will I regret missing my kid's soccer game to work on this spreadsheet?"

**Answer:** "I won't remember the deadline. I WILL regret missing the game."

**Decision:** Go to the game.

**This doesn't mean never work hard.** It means: Choose what's worth the sacrifice.

## Combining the Three Frameworks

**You can use all three together for complex decisions:**

### Example: Big Career Decision

**Decision:** "Should I take a high-paying job at BigCo or a lower-paying job at a mission-driven startup?"

**Step 1: Opportunity Cost Analysis**

**Option A (BigCo):**
- Gain: $300K salary, stability, prestige
- Lose: Mission alignment, autonomy, learning (established company, defined role)

**Option B (Startup):**
- Gain: Mission alignment, autonomy, rapid learning, equity upside
- Lose: $100K salary difference, stability, less prestigious brand

**Opportunity cost of A:** Mission, autonomy, learning
**Opportunity cost of B:** Money, stability, prestige

**Step 2: First Principles**

**Question assumptions:**
- "Do I actually need $300K? Or do I just think I should make that?"
- "Is prestige actually important to me? Or am I trying to impress others?"
- "What do I value? Money or mission?"

**Fundamental truths:**
- I value mission alignment (core value)
- I have enough savings to take lower salary
- Prestige doesn't actually make me happy (learned from past experience)

**Step 3: Regret Minimization**

**At 80:**
- "Will I regret taking the BigCo job for money?" → Probably yes (violates my value of mission)
- "Will I regret taking the startup job and making less money?" → Probably no (I chose meaning over money)

**Combined decision:**
- **Opportunity cost:** Acceptable (willing to trade money for mission)
- **First principles:** Aligned with values (mission > prestige)
- **Regret minimization:** Lower regret risk (won't wonder "what if I'd followed my values?")

**Final decision:** Take the startup job.

## Summary: Choosing the Right Framework

**Use these frameworks for different types of decisions:**

### Opportunity Cost Analysis
**When:** Allocating scarce resources (time, money, energy)
**Question:** "What am I giving up?"
**Best for:** Daily prioritization, resource trade-offs, evaluating options

### First Principles Thinking
**When:** Questioning assumptions, strategic pivots, complex problems
**Question:** "What's actually true?"
**Best for:** Challenging conventional wisdom, finding better paths

### Regret Minimization
**When:** Big, uncertain decisions with long-term impact
**Question:** "What will I regret?"
**Best for:** Career changes, life decisions, risk-taking

**You can combine them:**
- Use **first principles** to question assumptions
- Use **opportunity cost** to see trade-offs clearly
- Use **regret minimization** to make the final call

## Next Steps

**Practice using these frameworks:**

1. **Identify 1-2 decisions you're facing** (big or small)
2. **Apply one framework** to each
3. **Make the decision** (don't just analyze—decide)
4. **Reflect later** (did the framework help? Would you decide the same again?)

**Related references:**
- `01-values-clarification-foundation.md` - Values inform all decision-making
- `02-goal-setting-frameworks.md` - Goals flow from values and decisions
- `07-saying-no-professionally.md` - Decision to say no is easier with these frameworks
