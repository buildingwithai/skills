## When to Use This Guide

Use when you've created personas and need to actually use them to drive business results.

## Multi-Channel Persona Activation

### Persona-Based Campaigns

**Create separate campaigns for each persona:**
- Different landing pages per persona
- Persona-specific email sequences
- Targeted ad campaigns
- Persona-focused content

**Example: Slack's Persona Approach**
Result: 4.5x pipeline increase, 80% MQL-to-opportunity lift

### Channel Selection by Persona

**P1 (User):**
- Product demos, tutorial videos
- Community forums, Reddit
- YouTube, product-focused content

**P2 (Manager):**
- LinkedIn, industry publications
- Webinars on team productivity
- Management blogs

**P3 (Executive):**
- LinkedIn (decision-maker targeting)
- Industry conferences
- Analyst reports, executive briefings

## Sales Enablement with Personas

### Training Sales Teams

**What to provide:**
1. **One-pagers** per persona (quick reference)
2. **Discovery questions** specific to each persona
3. **Value prop variations** by persona
4. **Objection handling** by persona type
5. **Case studies** matching each persona

### Persona-Specific Talk Tracks

**Example for P2 (Manager):**
```
Discovery: "Tell me about your team's current workflow..."
Value prop: "Help your team close 20% more deals..."
Proof: "Similar managers at [Company] saw 25% productivity increase..."
```

### Equipping Champions

Create toolkits for each persona to share internally:
- Executive summaries (for P3)
- ROI calculators (for P2)
- Comparison matrices (for all)
- Proof libraries (case studies, data)

## Organization-Wide Rollout

### Distribution Methods

**1. Intranet Hub**
- Dedicated persona section
- Downloadable one-pagers

**2. Workshops**
- Lunch-and-learns (1 hour)

- Hands-on persona application

**3. Visual Aids**

**4. Digital Distribution**

### Two-Way Communication

**Critical:** Allow teams to ask questions and provide feedback

## Adoption Tactics

### Getting Teams to Actually Use Personas
