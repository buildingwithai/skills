# Workshop Facilitation

HOW to run effective persona workshops for stakeholder alignment and rapid persona creation.

## When to Use Workshops

- Need fast persona alignment (2-4 hours vs 6-10 weeks)
- Starting from zero (no research budget yet)
- Stakeholder buy-in required upfront
- Creating proto-personas to validate later

## Workshop Types

### Type 1: Proto-Persona Creation (2-4 hours)

**Goal:** Create assumption-based personas from internal knowledge

**Participants:** 6-10 people
- Sales (knows buyers)
- Customer Success (knows users)
- Product (knows use cases)
- Marketing
- Leadership

**Agenda:**

**0:00-0:15 - Intro & Goals**
- Why we're creating personas
- How we'll use them
- Timeline: 2-4 hours today, validate with customers in 4 weeks

**0:15-0:30 - Individual Brainstorm**
Each person creates 2-3 personas on sticky notes:
- Name & Role
- Top 3 goals
- Top 3 pains
- How they buy

**0:30-1:00 - Share & Cluster**
- Everyone shares personas (2 min each)
- Group similar personas together
- Vote on top 3-5 clusters

**1:00-2:00 - Build Out Top Personas**
- Split into groups (one per persona)
- Fill in persona template together
- Use whiteboard or Miro

**2:00-2:30 - Present & Refine**
- Each group presents persona
- Get feedback
- Finalize

**2:30-3:00 - Validation Planning**
- What assumptions need testing?
- Who should we interview?
- Schedule customer interviews

**Output:** 3-5 proto-personas + validation plan

### Type 2: Full Research Workshop (1-2 days)

**Goal:** Synthesize research into validated personas

**Prerequisites:** Already completed 10+ customer interviews

**Day 1 - Synthesis:**
- Review interview insights
- Identify patterns
- Create draft personas

**Day 2 - Refinement:**
- Build messaging per persona
- Create activation plan
- Assign owners

## Facilitation Best Practices

### Participant Selection (6-10 people ideal)

**Too few (<5):** Not enough diversity
**Too many (>12):** Hard to manage, quieter voices lost

**Include:**
- Customer-facing roles (sales, CS)
- Product/marketing
- At least one executive (for buy-in)

**Avoid:**
- All from one department
- Only people who agree with each other

### Remote Workshop Tools

**Collaboration:**
- Miro or Mural (visual whiteboard)
- Zoom for video
- Breakout rooms for small groups

**Templates:**
- Pre-built persona canvas in Miro
- Sticky note templates ready

### Handling Difficult Situations

**Silent participants:**
- Direct questions: "Sarah, what's your take?"
- Round-robin sharing (everyone goes)
- Anonymous sticky notes

**HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion):**
- Establish "data over opinion" rule upfront
- Ask "What customer evidence supports that?"
- Have executive share last (not first)

**Disagreements:**
- Acknowledge both perspectives
- Ask: "How could we test this with customers?"
- Mark as "assumption to validate"

**"That's not my job" attitudes:**
- Explain why personas help their role
- Show quick wins from other teams
- Get executive to reinforce importance

## Workshop Outputs

**By end of workshop:**
- [ ] 3-5 personas documented
- [ ] Each persona has goals, pains, behaviors
- [ ] Assumptions flagged for validation
- [ ] Validation plan with timeline
- [ ] Owner assigned to each persona
- [ ] Next steps scheduled

**Follow-up (within 1 week):**
- Clean up personas in nice format
- Distribute to all participants
- Schedule validation interviews
- Set date for validation review

## Common Workshop Mistakes

❌ **No prep:** Showing up without agenda
✅ **Fix:** Share agenda + pre-read 3 days before

❌ **Too long:** 4+ hour workshops lose energy
✅ **Fix:** Break into 2x 2-hour sessions

❌ **No follow-through:** Workshop ends, personas forgotten
✅ **Fix:** Assign owners, schedule follow-ups

❌ **Consensus required:** Trying to make everyone agree
✅ **Fix:** Document disagreements, plan to validate
