4. **Chad** (Growth Hacker) - Dwight equivalent, worships Jovanny, intense about metrics
5. **Marcus** (Sales, 23) - Cool, gives side-eye to Jovanny's try-hard energy
6. **Sarah** (Customer Success) - Pam equivalent, grounded, weary but patient
7. **Maya** (Product Designer) - Precious about pixels, design perfectionist
8. **Linda** (HR) - Toby equivalent, well-meaning buzzkill
