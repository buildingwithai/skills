## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Strategic Mistakes**:
1. **No charter or clear mission** → Enablement becomes order-taking instead of strategic
2. **Skipping business case** → No executive buy-in or adequate resourcing
3. **Wrong maturity assessment** → Building advanced programs without foundations
4. **Silo operation** → Not collaborating with marketing, product, CS, RevOps
5. **Tool-first approach** → Buying platforms before defining strategy and content

**Content & Program Mistakes**:
6. **Content dumping** → Overwhelming reps with too much material
7. **No governance** → Outdated, duplicate, or conflicting content (60% becomes unused)
8. **One-size-fits-all training** → Not adapting to roles, segments, or experience levels
9. **Feature-focused vs value-focused** → Teaching what product does vs what problems it solves
10. **No reinforcement** → 80-90% of training lost after one month without follow-up

**Execution Mistakes**:
11. **Poor change management** → New methodology/tool dies without adoption strategy
12. **No measurement** → Can't prove ROI or optimize programs
13. **Ignoring sales manager role** → Managers must reinforce and coach
14. **Weak onboarding** → Missing 54% productivity gain from formal programs
15. **Virtual enablement neglect** → Not adapting to remote/hybrid reality

**People & Culture Mistakes**:
16. **Wrong team structure** → Unclear roles and responsibilities
17. **No seller input** → Building programs without field feedback
18. **Top performer neglect** → Not leveraging and scaling best practices
19. **Culture misalignment** → Enablement at odds with sales culture and incentives
20. **Enabler skill gaps** → Hiring without content, tech, analytics, or facilitation skills
