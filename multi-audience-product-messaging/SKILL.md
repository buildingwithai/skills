### "Technical vs Non-Technical - Which Approach?"

**When communicating with TECHNICAL audiences:**
- Lead with: How it works, architecture, specifications
- Include: Technical depth, integrations, security details
- Emphasize: Features, capabilities, technical superiority
- Avoid: Oversimplification, missing technical details
- Use: Precise technical language, diagrams, data

**When communicating with NON-TECHNICAL audiences:**
- Lead with: What problems it solves, business outcomes
- Include: Benefits, ROI, risk reduction
- Emphasize: Results, ease of use, support
- Avoid: Technical jargon, acronyms without explanation
- Use: Analogies, stories, visual examples

**When addressing BOTH simultaneously:**
- Start with: Universal value proposition
- Layer: Benefits first, then features for those who want depth
- Provide: Multiple entry points (executive summary + technical appendix)
- Structure: Problem → Solution → How it works → Proof
- Test: Can both audiences understand the core message?

## Quick Reference: Typical Timelines

Based on industry best practices:

| Activity | Duration | Can be compressed? |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Positioning workshop | 1 week (3-5 sessions) | ⚠️ Not recommended |
| Messaging development | 2-3 weeks | ✓ Yes, to 1-2 weeks |
| Message testing (external) | 1-2 weeks | ✓ Yes, with platform like Wynter |
| Internal review cycle | 1-2 weeks | ✓ Yes, with pre-alignment |
| Sales enablement prep | 1-2 weeks | ⚠️ Not below 1 week |
| Sales training/rollout | 1 week | ⚠️ Not recommended |
| Soft launch (testing) | 2-3 weeks | ✓ Yes, for smaller changes |
| Full market launch | 4-8 weeks (phased) | ✓ Yes, but risky |
| **Total (full process)** | **9-12 weeks** | **6-8 weeks minimum** |

**Faster track** (minor updates): 4-6 weeks

## Key Principles

### Positioning Comes Before Messaging

You can't write effective messaging without clear positioning. Positioning answers:
- Who is this for? (Best-fit customers)
- What alternatives exist? (Competitive landscape)
- What makes us different? (Unique capabilities)
- What value do we deliver? (Differentiated benefits)
- What market are we in? (Category context)

### Messaging is Translation, Not Creation

Good messaging translates your positioning into language your audience understands and cares about. It's not about inventing new value - it's about articulating existing value clearly.

### Multiple Audiences Require Multiple Messages

B2B purchases involve 6-10 stakeholders with different priorities:
- **Users (P1)**: Does it work? Is it easy?
- **Champions (P2)**: Can I sell this internally?
- **Economic Buyers (P3)**: What's the ROI? What's the risk?

Each needs different messages, but all must ladder up to the same core positioning.

### Internal Adoption is Critical

Messaging only works if your team uses it. The rollout process is as important as the messaging itself:
1. Involve the right people early
2. Use customer evidence to build consensus
3. Enable, don't just inform
4. Reinforce through tools and systems

### Test Everything

Don't guess if messaging works - test it:
- Internally: Can sales reps explain your value in 30 seconds?
- Externally: Do prospects understand and care?
- Metrics: Clarity, relevance, differentiation, recall, action

### Facilitate Effectively

Running workshops requires skill:
- Manage energy and time carefully
- Handle difficult stakeholders professionally
- Drive to decisions, not just discussion
- Document everything visually

### Adapt by Sales Stage

Different buyer needs at different stages:
- Early: Lead with metrics and quantified value
- Mid: Support decision criteria and champion
- Late: Remove procurement friction
- Throughout: Differentiate from competition

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Skipping positioning** → Jumping straight to messaging without clear positioning leads to generic, undifferentiated messages
2. **Too many messages** → More than 5 core pillars dilutes focus
3. **Feature-focused** → Leading with features instead of benefits loses non-technical audiences
4. **One-size-fits-all** → Same message for all stakeholders doesn't resonate with anyone
5. **No customer voice** → Messaging created in a vacuum ignores what customers actually care about
6. **Weak internal rollout** → Great messaging that nobody uses is worthless
7. **No testing** → Launching without validation is guessing
8. **Set and forget** → Markets change, messaging must evolve
9. **Poor workshop facilitation** → Letting HiPPOs dominate or not driving to decisions
10. **Ignoring sales stages** → Using same message for awareness and decision stages

   - Need to adapt messaging by sales stage? See `11-sales-stage-competitive-strategy.md`

2. **Load the relevant references** for your situation

3. **Use the templates** to organize your work

4. **Follow the process** - don't skip steps

5. **Test and iterate** - messaging is never "done"

## Support & Customization

This skill is designed to be adapted to your specific situation:

- **Adjust timelines** based on your constraints
- **Skip phases** that don't apply (e.g., if positioning is solid, start with messaging)
- **Add company-specific sections** to templates
