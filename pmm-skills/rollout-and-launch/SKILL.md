# Rollout & Launch

Test your messaging, align your organization, and launch to market with confidence.

**✨ COMPREHENSIVE**: Deeply researched guides on message testing platforms, workshop facilitation techniques, and stakeholder management strategies.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Test messaging** before launch with target audience
- **Run internal workshops** to align stakeholders on positioning/messaging
- **Train teams** (sales, CS, marketing) on new messaging
- **Create enablement materials** for consistent usage
- **Launch messaging externally** with phased approach
- **Measure rollout success** and iterate

**NOT for:**
- Creating positioning (use `positioning` skill first)
- Developing messaging (use `messaging` skill first)

## Prerequisites

### Positioning and Messaging Must Be Complete

Rollout and launch happens AFTER you've created positioning and messaging. You need:

✅ **Completed positioning** - Clear differentiation and market category
✅ **Finalized messaging** - Pillars, proof points, multi-audience variations
✅ **Executive sponsorship** - Leadership commitment to champion and enforce

**If you haven't completed these:**
→ Use the `positioning` skill first to create your foundation
→ Then use `messaging` skill to develop your messages
→ Then return here for rollout and launch

## The Rollout & Launch Process

The complete process from testing to market launch:

**Timeline:** 3-6 weeks from testing to full market launch

```
TESTING → INTERNAL ROLLOUT → ENABLEMENT → EXTERNAL LAUNCH → MEASUREMENT
(Week 1-2)  (Week 2-4)         (Week 3-4)   (Week 4-6)        (Ongoing)
```

## Quick Decision Trees

**Testing messaging before launch:**
→ Read: core/01-message-testing.md
→ Choose platform: Wynter (B2B), UserTesting (general), or internal methods
→ Timeline: 1-2 weeks

**Running internal workshops:**
→ Read: core/02-internal-rollout.md + core/03-workshop-facilitation.md
→ Use: 4-workshop process (positioning → messaging → refinement → training)
→ Timeline: 2-4 weeks

**Creating enablement materials:**
→ Read: core/02-internal-rollout.md (section on materials)
→ Use: assets/templates/enablement-checklist.md
→ Timeline: 1 week parallel to workshops

**Launching to market:**
→ Read: core/04-external-launch.md
→ Use: Phased approach (internal first, then external)
→ Timeline: 2-3 weeks

**Managing difficult stakeholders:**
→ Read: core/03-workshop-facilitation.md (HiPPO management section)
→ Use: Techniques for building buy-in without consensus paralysis

## Key Principles

### 1. Test Before You Launch

Don't guess if messaging works - validate it:

**Internal testing:**
- Can sales explain your value in 30 seconds?
- Do they understand the differentiation?
- Can they articulate the pillars?

**External testing:**
- Do prospects understand what you do?
- Is it relevant to their problems?
- Does it differentiate from alternatives?

**Metrics to track:** Clarity, relevance, value, differentiation, brand

### 2. Internal Before External

Launch internally first to ensure consistency:

**Why this matters:**
- Sales won't use messaging they don't understand
- Marketing will create off-brand content without guidance
- Inconsistent messaging confuses prospects
- Strong internal rollout = confident external launch

**Timeline:** Allow 2-4 weeks for internal alignment before external launch

### 3. Workshops Build Buy-In

The best messaging fails without organizational commitment:

**The 4-workshop process:**
1. **Workshop 1**: Positioning alignment (core team)
2. **Workshop 2**: Messaging development (core + contributors)
3. **Workshop 3**: Refinement & application (contributors + stakeholders)
4. **Workshop 4**: Rollout & training (all teams)

Each workshop serves a purpose - don't skip steps.

### 4. Enablement Materials Matter

Training without materials leads to inconsistency:

**Essential materials:**
- Messaging house (one-pager)
- Sales deck template
- Email templates
- Battle cards
- Channel-specific guidelines

Make it easier to use new messaging than old messaging.

### 5. Launch is a Process, Not an Event

Successful launches are phased, not big-bang:

**Phased approach:**
1. **Internal alignment** (2-4 weeks)
2. **Soft launch** (update owned channels)
3. **Sales enablement** (new outreach)
4. **Paid media** (ads, campaigns)
5. **Broad PR/AR** (thought leadership)

Allow time for feedback and iteration at each phase.

## Typical Timeline

| Activity | Duration | Can Compress? |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Message testing (external) | 1-2 weeks | ✓ Yes, to 3-5 days with platforms |
| Internal workshops | 2-4 weeks | ⚠️ Can compress to 2 weeks (risky) |
| Enablement creation | 1 week | ✓ Yes, to 3-5 days (parallel work) |
| External launch (phased) | 2-3 weeks | ⚠️ Not below 1 week (too risky) |
| **Total** | **3-6 weeks** | **Can compress to 3 weeks** |

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Skipping testing** → Launching untested messaging leads to expensive mistakes
2. **No internal rollout** → Teams don't use messaging they weren't involved in creating
3. **Too many workshops** → Analysis paralysis, momentum dies
4. **No executive sponsorship** → Without top-down support, adoption is optional
5. **Training without materials** → Good intentions don't translate to consistent usage
6. **Big-bang launch** → All channels at once = no room for iteration
7. **No measurement** → Can't improve what you don't measure

## Getting Started

**Ready to test messaging?**
1. Read core/01-message-testing.md
2. Choose testing method (external platform or internal)
3. Test with 15-30 people from your ICP
4. Iterate based on results

**Ready to roll out internally?**
1. Read core/02-internal-rollout.md
2. Map your stakeholders (core, contributors, broader org)
3. Schedule the 4 workshops over 2-4 weeks
4. Create enablement materials in parallel

**Ready to launch externally?**
1. Ensure internal rollout is complete
2. Read core/04-external-launch.md

4. Phase in paid and earned media
5. Measure and iterate
