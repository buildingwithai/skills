# Product Messaging

Create messaging that resonates with both technical and non-technical audiences using proven frameworks.

**✨ COMPREHENSIVE**: Includes deeply researched guides on sales stage-specific messaging mapped to MEDDIC/MEDDICC.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Create messaging** for B2B SaaS products based on positioning
- **Write value propositions** that resonate with multiple stakeholders
- **Adapt messaging** for technical vs non-technical audiences
- **Develop message architecture** (pillars, proof points, hierarchy)
- **Sales-stage messaging** mapped to MEDDIC/MEDDICC

**NOT for:**
- Positioning (use `positioning` skill first)
- Testing, workshops, internal rollout, or launch (use `rollout-and-launch` skill)
- Competitive analysis (use `competitive-intelligence` skill)

## Prerequisites

### Positioning Must Be Complete

Messaging translates positioning into customer language. You need:

✅ **Completed positioning** - Who you're for, what alternatives exist, why you're different
✅ **Best-fit customers defined** - Who gets the most value
✅ **Differentiated value** - Clear unique value proposition

**If you haven't done positioning:**
→ Use the `positioning` skill first
→ Complete positioning canvas
→ Then return here for messaging

## The Messaging Process

Messaging transforms positioning into communication:

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks from positioning to finalized messages

```
POSITIONING → MESSAGING DEVELOPMENT → MULTI-AUDIENCE ADAPTATION → ARCHITECTURE
(complete)    (Week 1-2)              (Week 2-3)                  (Week 3)
```

→ Use: assets/templates/messaging-canvas-template.md
→ Timeline: 2-3 weeks

**Messaging for technical buyers:**
→ Read: core/03-multi-audience-messaging.md (technical section)
→ Also see: core/11-sales-stage-competitive-strategy.md (economic buyer messaging)

**Messaging for non-technical buyers:**
→ Read: core/03-multi-audience-messaging.md (non-technical section)
→ Focus on: Benefits, outcomes, risk reduction

**Sales-stage messaging:**
→ Read: core/11-sales-stage-competitive-strategy.md
→ Map to: MEDDIC components

**Testing messaging or running workshops:**
→ Use the `rollout-and-launch` skill for testing and internal rollout

## Key Principles

### 1. Messaging is Translation, Not Creation

Messaging translates your positioning into language your audience understands:

**Positioning (foundation):**
- Who we're for
- What alternatives exist
- Why we're different

**Messaging (communication):**
- How we talk about it
- What words we use
- Which benefits we emphasize

### 2. Multiple Audiences Need Multiple Messages

B2B purchases involve 6-10 stakeholders with different priorities:

- **Users (P1)**: Does it work? Is it easy?
- **Champions (P2)**: Can I sell this internally?
- **Economic Buyers (P3)**: What's the ROI? What's the risk?

Each needs different messages, but all must ladder up to same positioning.

### 3. Features Tell, Benefits Sell

Transform features into outcomes:

❌ **Feature**: "Advanced API with 99.99% uptime"
✅ **Benefit**: "Your developers ship integrations faster without worrying about downtime"

### 4. Test Everything

Don't guess if messaging works - test it. Use the `rollout-and-launch` skill for:

- **Internal testing**: Can sales explain your value in 30 seconds?
- **External testing**: Do prospects understand and care?
- **Metrics**: Clarity, relevance, differentiation, recall, action

## Related Skills

**Prerequisites (complete first):**
- **`positioning`** - Create positioning before messaging

**Next steps after messaging:**
- **`rollout-and-launch`** - Roll out messaging internally and launch externally

**Complementary skills:**
- **`competitive-intelligence`** - Competitive differentiation in messaging
- **`gtm-strategy`** - Full go-to-market orchestration
- **`pricing-packaging`** - Pricing/value messaging

## Outputs from This Skill

When you complete messaging, you'll have:

✅ **Message architecture** - Pillars, proof points, hierarchy
✅ **Multi-audience messages** - For P1, P2, P3 stakeholders
✅ **Value propositions** - Clear, differentiated messaging
✅ **Sales-stage messaging** - Mapped to MEDDIC

**Next:** Use `rollout-and-launch` skill to test, roll out internally, and launch to market.

## Typical Timeline

| Activity | Duration | Can Compress? |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Messaging development | 1-2 weeks | ✓ Yes, to 3-5 days |
| Multi-audience adaptation | 3-5 days | ✓ Yes, to 1-2 days |
| Message architecture | 2-3 days | ⚠️ Not below 1 day |
| **Total** | **2-3 weeks** | **Can compress to 1 week** |

**Note:** Testing and rollout add 3-6 weeks - see `rollout-and-launch` skill.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Skipping positioning** → Messaging without positioning is guessing
2. **One-size-fits-all** → Same message for all stakeholders doesn't resonate
3. **Feature-focused** → Leading with features instead of benefits loses non-technical audiences
4. **Too many messages** → More than 5 core pillars dilutes focus
5. **Skipping testing/rollout** → Use `rollout-and-launch` skill to validate and deploy

## Getting Started

**New to messaging?**
1. **Ensure positioning is complete** (use `positioning` skill if not)
2. Read core/02-pain-claim-gain-messaging.md
3. Complete messaging canvas template
4. Adapt for multiple audiences (core/03-multi-audience)
5. Move to `rollout-and-launch` skill for testing and deployment

**Have experience?**
1. Scan core/02-pain-claim-gain for refresher
2. Jump to specific need (multi-audience, sales-stage)
3. Use templates and get to work

**Ready to test and launch?**
→ Move to `rollout-and-launch` skill for testing, internal rollout, and market launch
