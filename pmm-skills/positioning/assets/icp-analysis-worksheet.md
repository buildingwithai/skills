# ICP Analysis Worksheet

Data-driven template for identifying your best-fit customers (Ideal Customer Profile).

## Overview

**Purpose**: Systematically identify who cares most about your differentiated value so you can position precisely for them.

**Why this matters**:
- You can't position for everyone
- Your top 20% customers deliver 80%+ of value
- Positioning for best-fit customers makes you obviously the best choice for them
- Narrow positioning beats broad positioning in win rates and deal velocity

**Based on**: Gartner 2024 ICP Framework + SPICED Methodology + Beachhead Strategy

**Time to complete**: 4-8 hours spread over 1-2 weeks (includes data analysis + customer interviews)

## Part 1: Top 20% Analysis (Quantitative)

Identify patterns in your best customers through data.

### Step 1: Pull Your Customer Data (30 minutes)

Export from CRM/ERP/Data Warehouse:

**Required fields**:
- Customer name
- Industry/vertical
- Company size (revenue, employees)
- Contract value (ACV/TCV)
- Date acquired
- Current ARR/MRR
- Expansion revenue
- Churn status
- Time to value (first success milestone)
- Product usage metrics
- NPS or CSAT score

**Data source**: [Salesforce / HubSpot / Other: ____________]

**Date range**: Last [12 / 24] months

**Total customers in dataset**: _______

---

### Step 2: Calculate Customer Value Score (45 minutes)

Not all customers are equal. Score each customer:

**Scoring formula** (adjust weights for your business):

| Metric | Weight | How to Score |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Lifetime Value (LTV)** | 30% | Actual LTV or: (ACV × avg customer lifetime) |
| **Time to Value** | 20% | Days to first success milestone (lower = better) |
| **Expansion Rate** | 20% | $ expansion / original contract value |
| **Product Engagement** | 15% | Usage score: DAU/MAU or feature adoption |
| **NPS/Advocacy** | 10% | NPS score or # of referrals given |
| **Low Maintenance** | 5% | Support tickets (lower = better) |

**Your weights** (must total 100%):

| Metric | Your Weight | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Lifetime Value | ____% | |
| Time to Value | ____% | |
| Expansion Rate | ____% | |
| Product Engagement | ____% | |
| NPS/Advocacy | ____% | |
| Low Maintenance | ____% | |
| **Total** | **100%** | |

**Calculate scores** for all customers, then sort by total score.

## 2024 ICP Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Superhuman (Email Client)

**Initial ICP** (extremely narrow):
- **Who**: VCs, founders, C-suite executives
- **Situation**: Process 100+ emails per day
- **Pain**: Email is slowing them down, inbox zero impossible
- **Impact**: Missing important emails, hours wasted daily
- **Trigger**: Inbox overwhelming (500+ unread)
- **Criteria**: Speed, keyboard shortcuts, beautiful design

**Beachhead strategy**:
- Dominated SF/NYC tech exec market first
- Viral within VC/founder networks
- $30/month price point validated willingness to pay
- Waitlist created exclusivity/demand

**Results**:
- 90%+ of target ICP adopted in SF within 18 months
- Expanded to broader "email power users" only after dominating beachhead
- Maintained premium positioning throughout

**Lesson**: Narrow ICP = faster domination = expansion from position of strength

---

### Case Study 2: Gong (Revenue Intelligence)

**Evolved ICP**:

**Phase 1 ICP** (2016-2018): Sales leaders at 50-200 person B2B SaaS companies
- **Why**: Needed revenue, had budget, understood value quickly
- **Beachhead**: SF Bay Area SaaS companies

**Phase 2 ICP** (2019-2021): Expanded to enterprise (500+ sales reps)
- **Why**: Dominated mid-market, ready for upmarket expansion
- **Product evolution**: Built enterprise features (integrations, security, scale)

**Phase 3 ICP** (2022-2024): Revenue teams (not just sales - marketing, CS too)
- **Why**: Product expanded to full revenue org
- **Positioning evolution**: "Revenue Intelligence Platform" → "Revenue AI"

**Lesson**: ICP evolves as you dominate segments and product expands. Start narrow, expand systematically.

## Quarterly ICP Review

Every quarter, review ICP health:

**Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 Review Questions**:

1. **Are we winning with our ICP?**
   - Win rate with ICP customers: ____%
   - Win rate outside ICP: ____%
   - If gap < 20%, ICP may be wrong

2. **Is our top 20% still the same profile?**
   - Re-run top 20% analysis
   - Look for drift in characteristics

3. **Have market conditions changed?**
   - New competitors targeting our ICP?
   - ICP priorities shifted?
   - New pain points emerged?

4. **Should we expand ICP?**
   - Have we dominated current beachhead?
   - Is adjacent segment ready?
   - Do we have product/GTM capability?

5. **Should we narrow ICP?**
   - Are we too scattered?
   - Losing focus by targeting too broadly?
   - Better to dominate smaller segment?

**Review output**:

☐ **Keep current ICP** - still accurate and we're winning

☐ **Refine ICP** - adjust based on data (minor tweaks)

☐ **Expand ICP** - add adjacent segment (we've dominated current)

☐ **Narrow ICP** - focus on subset (we're too broad)

☐ **Redefine ICP** - major pivot needed (rare)
