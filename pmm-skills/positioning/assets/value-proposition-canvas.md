# Value Proposition Canvas Template

Visual framework for aligning your product value with customer needs (Strategyzer method).

## Overview

**Purpose**: Map your product's value proposition to your customer's jobs, pains, and gains to ensure product-market fit and strong positioning.

**Created by**: Alexander Osterwalder (Strategyzer), companion to Business Model Canvas

**Best for**:
- Validating product-market fit
- Identifying positioning opportunities
- Aligning product value with customer needs
- Discovering gaps in value delivery
- Workshop exercises with cross-functional teams

**Time to complete**: 2-4 hours in workshop format

**Visual format**: Two interlocking circles - Customer Profile + Value Map

---

## The Framework

The Value Proposition Canvas has two sides:

### Right Side: Customer Profile (What they care about)
- **Customer Jobs**: What they're trying to accomplish
- **Pains**: Problems, obstacles, and risks
- **Gains**: Desired outcomes and benefits

### Left Side: Value Map (What you offer)
- **Products & Services**: What you provide
- **Pain Relievers**: How you alleviate pains
- **Gain Creators**: How you create gains

**Fit = When your value map addresses customer profile**

---

## CUSTOMER PROFILE (Right Side)

Map your best-fit customer segment (ICP).

### Customer Jobs

**What functional, social, and emotional jobs is your customer trying to get done?**

**Functional Jobs** (tasks they need to complete):
- What tasks are they trying to perform?
- What problems are they trying to solve?
- What needs are they trying to satisfy?

**Social Jobs** (how they want to be perceived):
- How do they want to be seen by others?
- What status or reputation are they seeking?
- What do they want to appear to be?

**Emotional Jobs** (how they want to feel):
- What emotions do they seek?
- What feelings do they want to achieve?
- How do they want to feel about themselves?

|---------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| | | ☐ Fully ☐ Partially ☐ Poorly | |
| | | ☐ Fully ☐ Partially ☐ Poorly | |
| | | ☐ Fully ☐ Partially ☐ Poorly | |

## Positioning Implications

### From Value Prop Canvas to Positioning

Use insights to refine positioning elements:

#### Best-Fit Customers
**Who has the pains you relieve best?**: ____________________________________

**Who values the gains you create most?**: __________________________________

**Refine ICP based on fit**: _______________________________________________

---

#### Differentiated Value
**Which pain relievers are unique to you?**: ________________________________

**Which gain creators are unique to you?**: _________________________________

**Core value proposition**: ________________________________________________

---

#### Competitive Alternatives
**What are customers using today that doesn't relieve these pains?**: _________

**What alternatives deliver SOME gains but not all?**: ______________________

---

#### Market Category
**What category sets expectations for these pains/gains?**: __________________

**Does existing category fit, or need new category?**: ______________________

---

## Testing Your Value Proposition

**Before finalizing positioning**, validate value prop fit:

### Customer Interview Testing (10-15 interviews)

**Show them your pain relievers**:
- "Is this pain real for you?" (validate pains)
- "Would this solution address it?" (validate pain reliever)
- "How important is solving this?" (prioritize)

**Show them your gain creators**:
- "Is this gain valuable to you?" (validate gains)
- "Would you pay for this outcome?" (validate willingness to pay)
- "How much is this worth?" (pricing insight)

**Record responses**:

| Customer | Pain Validated? | Gain Validated? | Would Pay? | Key Insights |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| | ☐ Yes ☐ No | ☐ Yes ☐ No | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |
| | ☐ Yes ☐ No | ☐ Yes ☐ No | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |
| | ☐ Yes ☐ No | ☐ Yes ☐ No | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |

---

### Message Testing (Wynter)

**Test pain-focused messaging**:
- "We solve [pain] by [pain reliever]"
- Measure: Relevance score (target 3.5+/5)

**Test gain-focused messaging**:
- "We help you [gain] through [gain creator]"
- Measure: Value score (target 3.5+/5)

**Results**:
- Pain-focused relevance: ___/5
- Gain-focused value: ___/5
- Which resonates more: ☐ Pain ☐ Gain

**Positioning implication**: Lead with [pain / gain] in messaging

## 2024 Case Study: Userlist

**Challenge**: Positioned as "email automation for SaaS" - crowded category, low differentiation

**Value Prop Canvas Exercise Insights**:

**Customer pains discovered**:
- Generic email tools don't understand SaaS metrics (MRR, plan tier, feature usage)
- Setting up behavior-based campaigns requires engineering help
- Can't segment by product usage easily
- Email workflows break when customer data changes

**Customer gains desired**:
- Send right message based on user behavior + subscription status
- No-code setup (marketing can do it)
- Automatic segmentation by product usage
- Lifecycle campaigns that adapt to customer journey

**Value map insights**:
- Core differentiator: Native SaaS data integration (Stripe, product analytics)
- Pain reliever: No engineering required for behavioral campaigns
- Gain creator: Automatic segments based on subscription + usage

**Repositioning**: "Customer messaging for SaaS companies"
- Created subcategory (not email automation, not generic messaging)
- Emphasized SaaS-specific capabilities
- Targeted narrow ICP: B2B SaaS companies with freemium/trial models

**Result**: "Magic effect on customer understanding" - resonated immediately with ICP
