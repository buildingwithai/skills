# Positioning Foundation

Complete guide to product positioning using April Dunford's proven methodology.

## Overview

Positioning is the foundation of all messaging and go-to-market strategy. It defines how you want your product to be perceived in the market and by whom.

**April Dunford's definition:** "Positioning is the act of deliberately defining how you are the best at something that a defined market cares a lot about."

**Why positioning matters:**
- Amplifies all marketing and sales efforts
- Makes your value obvious to the right people
- Differentiates you from alternatives
- Aligns internal teams on strategy
- Informs every GTM decision

**2024 Update**: Companies that invest in rigorous positioning see dramatic results:
- **Databook**: 67% conversion increase, 10x lead growth (repositioned from "sales intelligence" to "SRM" category)
- **Userlist**: "Magic effect on customer understanding" (repositioned from "email automation" to "customer messaging")
- **Testing is critical**: Wynter data shows companies improve 40-73% by testing positioning before launch

**Key distinction**: Positioning ≠ Messaging
- **Positioning** (internal strategy): Who you compete against, what makes you different, why customers choose you
- **Messaging** (external communication): How you talk about that positioning in different contexts

**Positioning comes first.** You can't create effective messaging without solid positioning foundation.

## When to Do Positioning Work

### Do positioning work when:
- Launching a new product
- Sales cycles are too long or deals stall
- Win rates are declining
- Lots of "no decision" losses (typically 40% of B2B deals)
- Teams can't articulate your value consistently
- Messaging feels generic or undifferentiated
- Market conditions have shifted significantly
- You've added major new capabilities
- Internal teams are misaligned on who you serve and why

### Don't do positioning yet when:
- You're pre-product-market fit (keep testing, stay flexible)
- You have fewer than 10 customers
- You're still validating the problem/solution
- Product is changing rapidly week-to-week

**The "fishing net" analogy**: If you think you're catching groupers but you're pulling up tuna, don't position as a grouper net yet. Keep your positioning loose while you discover who actually bites.

## The Five Components of Effective Positioning

Every positioning has these five interconnected elements:

### 1. Competitive Alternatives

**What customers would do if your product didn't exist.**

This is NOT just your direct competitors. It includes:
- Direct competitors (products that look like yours)
- Indirect competitors (different solutions to the same problem)
- Status quo (spreadsheets, manual processes, "do nothing")
- Workarounds customers have built themselves

**Why it matters**: You can't position in a vacuum. Your value is always relative to what customers would otherwise do.

**Critical insight (2024)**: Most companies get this wrong by only looking at direct competitors. Your real competitive alternatives might be:
- **Status quo** (biggest competitor - customers choose "do nothing" 40% of the time)
- **DIY solutions** (spreadsheets, homegrown tools)
- **Manual processes** (what they do today without software)

**Questions to ask:**
- What were our best customers doing before they found us?
- What do prospects compare us to in the sales process?
- When we lose deals, what beats us? (including "no decision")
- If we disappeared tomorrow, what would customers use instead?

**Example**: Slack's competitive alternatives aren't just other chat apps - they include **email** (primary alternative customers replaced), in-person meetings, phone calls, and scattered communication tools.

**2024 Example**: Databook initially positioned against "sales intelligence tools" (ZoomInfo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator). Testing revealed real alternatives were **spreadsheets and manual relationship tracking**. Repositioning to new "SRM" category = 10x lead growth.

**→ For comprehensive guide**: See [Competitive Alternatives Analysis](/references/core/02-competitive-alternatives-analysis.md)

### 2. Differentiated Capabilities (Unique Attributes)

**What you can do that alternatives can't.**

These are your unique features, approaches, or characteristics that create meaningful differences.

**Not all differences matter** - focus on ones that:
- Solve real customer problems
- Are defensible (hard to copy)
- Connect to value customers care about
- Are provable (not marketing fluff)

**How to find them:**
- List all your features/capabilities
- Compare against alternatives (what do ONLY you have?)
- Ask customers what surprised/delighted them about your product
- Look at what you're known for in the market

**Common traps:**
- Listing features customers don't care about
- Claiming differences that aren't actually unique
- Focusing on internal pride points vs customer value

**Example**: Help Scout's differentiated capability wasn't just being a help desk - it was their "treat customers as humans, not tickets" philosophy embedded in product design.

### 3. Differentiated Value

**The benefit customers get from your unique capabilities.**

This translates "what you do" into "what customers get."

**Structure**: Because we have [unique capability], customers get [specific benefit].

**Types of value:**
- Functional: Does the job better/faster/cheaper
- Emotional: Reduces anxiety, builds confidence
- Social: Status, perception by others
- Economic: Saves money, increases revenue

**Value for different personas:**
- Technical buyers care about: Integration, security, reliability
- Economic buyers care about: ROI, risk reduction, strategic alignment
- Users care about: Ease of use, getting job done, looking good

**Example**: Postman's differentiated value isn't "API platform" - it's "developers can build and use APIs faster, with fewer errors, and better collaboration."

### 4. Best-Fit Customers

**Who cares most about your differentiated value.**

This is NOT your total addressable market. It's the customers for whom you're obviously the best choice.

**Characteristics of best-fit customers:**
- Understood your product quickly
- Bought from you quickly
- Became raving fans
- Referred others to you
- Represent your ideal type of customer (for now)

**How to identify them:**
- List your 5-10 best customers (or top 20% by LTV)
- Look for patterns in:
  - Industry/vertical
  - Company size
  - Use case
  - Technical sophistication
  - Buying behavior
  - What they value most

**2024 Best Practice - Data-Driven ICP Analysis**:
- **Quantitative**: Analyze CRM/ERP data for patterns (LTV, churn, time-to-value)
- **Qualitative**: Interview top customers to understand "why"
- **SPICED Framework**: Situation, Pain, Impact, Critical Event, Decision Criteria

**Beachhead Strategy**: Focus on narrow segment you can dominate (1,000-5,000 companies) in 12-18 months, then expand.

**Narrower is better (at least initially)**: It's better to be the obvious choice for a specific group than an "also considered" choice for everyone.

**Example**: Superhuman (email client) launched with extremely narrow ICP: VCs, founders, executives who process 100+ emails/day. Dominated this segment before expanding.

**→ For comprehensive guide**: See [ICP-Driven Positioning](/references/core/03-icp-driven-positioning.md)

### 5. Market Category

**The context that makes your value obvious.**

This is the mental "box" prospects use to understand and evaluate your product.

**Why it matters**: The category sets expectations about:
- What problems you solve
- Who you compete with
- How much you should cost
- What features you should have

**Three positioning approaches:**

#### Head-to-Head Positioning
**Compete directly in an existing category.**

- Best when: You have significant advantages in an established market
- Approach: "We're like [category leader] but better at [specific thing]"
- Example: Avis vs Hertz - "We're #2, so we try harder"
- Risk: Requires significant resources to challenge established players

#### Big Fish, Small Pond Positioning
**Dominate a subcategory of an existing market.**

- Best when: You're strong in a specific segment
- Approach: "We're the best [existing category] for [specific use case/industry]"
- Example: Community Coffee - dominant in Louisiana, small nationally
- Risk: Limiting growth by being too narrow

#### Create New Category Positioning
**Define an entirely new market category.**

- Best when: Your product is truly novel and existing categories don't fit
- Approach: "We're not [old category], we're [new category]"
- Example: Salesforce - "No software" (created cloud CRM category)
- Risk: Requires massive investment to educate market on new category

**How to choose:**
- Where can you credibly claim to be the best?
- What context makes your strengths obvious?
- Where do customers naturally put you?
- What comparisons work in your favor?

## The 10-Step Positioning Process

This is April Dunford's systematic method for working through positioning. Best done as a team workshop over 1 week.

### Pre-Work (Before Step 1)

**Identify your best customers**: List 5-10 customers who:
- Bought quickly and understood your value immediately
- Became successful users
- Refer others to you frequently
- Represent your ideal customer type

**Assemble the right team**: Include:
- Product Marketing (lead)
- Product Management
- Sales (top reps who win deals)
- Customer Success (talk to customers daily)
- Founder/CEO (for tie-breaking and context)

**Set expectations**: This is collaborative discovery, not marketing telling everyone what to think.

### Step 1: List Your Competitive Alternatives

**Time: 30-60 minutes**

List everything customers might do if your product didn't exist:
- Direct competitors
- Different types of solutions
- Manual processes
- Status quo/do nothing

**Key question**: What were our best customers doing before us?

**Output**: Comprehensive list of all alternatives (usually 5-15 items)

### Step 2: List Your Unique Attributes

**Time: 45-90 minutes**

What can you do that alternatives cannot?

Consider:
- Features unique to your product
- Approach or methodology differences
- Technical architecture advantages
- Service model differences
- Business model differences

**Key question**: If we removed our branding and our competitors' branding, what's truly unique about what we offer?

**Output**: List of 10-20 potential unique attributes

**Common issue**: Teams list things that aren't actually unique or things customers don't care about. Challenge each item: "Is this really unique? Do customers care?"

### Step 3: Map Attributes to Value (Value Propositions)

**Time: 60-90 minutes**

For each unique attribute, determine what value it provides.

**Framework**: Because we have [unique attribute], customers get [specific benefit].

**Consider value for different personas:**
- What does the user get?
- What does the champion (internal seller) get?
- What does the economic buyer get?

**Key question**: So what? Why should customers care about this attribute?

**Output**: Mapped attributes to value for each persona

### Step 4: Determine Who Cares Most

**Time: 45-60 minutes**

Looking at your value propositions, which customer segments care most?

**Analysis approach:**
- Review your list of best customers
- Look for patterns in who values what
- Consider who has the pain you solve most acutely
- Think about who can see and pay for your value

**Key question**: For whom is our value the most compelling and obvious?

**Output**: Clear description of your best-fit customer segment

**Note**: You may discover you have different positioning for different segments. That's okay - you can position differently for each, but they should be distinct segments.

### Step 5: Determine the Best Market Category

**Time: 60-90 minutes**

What market context makes your differentiated value obvious to your best-fit customers?

**Test different categories:**
- Existing categories you could compete in
- Subcategories of existing markets
- Potential new categories

**For each, ask:**
- Does this context make our strengths obvious?
- Can we credibly claim to be the best here?
- Will customers understand this framing?
- What comparisons does this invite? (Do they favor us?)

**Three strategies** (from Component #5 above):
- Head-to-head: Direct competition in existing category
- Big fish, small pond: Dominate a subcategory
- Create new: Define entirely new category

**Key question**: What context makes it obvious that we're the best choice?

**Output**: Chosen market category with reasoning

### Step 6: Validate with Market Trends

**Time: 30-45 minutes**

Are there market trends that make customers care more RIGHT NOW?

**Good trends:**
- Regulatory changes forcing action
- Technology shifts enabling new approaches
- Economic pressures creating urgency
- Competitive landscape changes

**Bad trends:**
- Generic industry growth (everyone can claim this)
- Trends with no clear connection to your value

**Key question**: Why should customers act now? What's changing that makes this urgent?

**Output**: 1-2 specific trends that validate your positioning (or "no relevant trends")

**Warning**: Only use trends if there's a clear, specific link to your product. Vague trend-jacking damages credibility.

### Step 7: Competitive Analysis

**Time: 45-60 minutes**

For your chosen market category, who are the key alternatives?

Map your main competitors on:
- Their positioning (how do they describe themselves?)
- Their strengths
- Their weaknesses
- Where they're vulnerable

**Key question**: In our chosen market context, where do we win vs lose?

**Output**: Competitive matrix showing how you compare in your chosen category

### Step 8: Write Your Positioning Statement

**Time: 30-45 minutes**

Synthesize Steps 1-7 into a clear positioning statement.

**Template**:

For [best-fit customers who have [key problem],
[Product name] is a [market category]
That [key benefit/value proposition].

Unlike [competitive alternatives],
We [unique capabilities that deliver the value].

**Example (fictional B2B data tool)**:

For mid-market B2B SaaS companies that struggle with scattered customer data,
DataUnify is a customer data platform
That gives you a single source of truth about every customer, so you can personalize at scale.

Unlike stitching together multiple tools or building custom solutions,
We automatically connect to 50+ data sources and use AI to resolve customer identities in real-time.

**Output**: Clear, concise positioning statement

### Step 9: Define Messaging Pillars

**Time: 45-60 minutes**

Based on your positioning, what are the 3-5 key themes in your messaging?

These pillars support your value proposition and should each:
- Address a customer pain point
- Highlight a unique strength
- Be provable with evidence

**Example pillars** (for DataUnify example):
1. **Complete Customer View**: See all customer interactions in one place
2. **Automated Integration**: Connect your tools in minutes, not months
3. **AI-Powered Identity**: Know who your customers really are
4. **Scale Without Complexity**: Handle millions of records easily

**Output**: 3-5 messaging pillars that will guide all communications

### Step 10: Create Positioning Document

**Time: 30-45 minutes**

Document everything in a shareable format.

**Include:**
- Positioning statement
- Best-fit customers (with description)
- Competitive alternatives
- Unique capabilities
- Differentiated value
- Market category and reasoning
- Relevant trends (if any)
- Messaging pillars
- Competitive landscape
- What we're NOT (help teams understand boundaries)

**Format**: Use the positioning canvas template (see April Dunford's website for original, or use messaging-canvas-template.xlsx in assets/)

**Output**: Complete positioning document ready for **testing** (don't skip this!)

---

## Step 11: TEST Your Positioning (Critical 2024 Addition)

**DO NOT SKIP TESTING**

Companies that test positioning before launch see 40-73% better results:
- Databook: 10x lead growth
- Cognism: 43% conversion increase
- Appcues: 73% improvement

**Two testing approaches**:

**External Testing (Recommended)**:
- **Wynter platform**: $899, results in 12-48 hours
- Test with verified B2B professionals from your ICP
- Measures: Clarity (target 4.0+/5), Relevance (3.5+/5), Value (3.5+/5), Differentiation (3.0+/5)

**Internal Testing (Budget-Friendly)**:
- Customer/prospect interviews (10-15 people)
- Landing page tests ($200-500)
- 5-second comprehension tests

**What to test**:
- Can they understand what you do in 10 seconds?
- Is it relevant to their challenges?
- Do they see the differentiated value?
- Can they explain how you're different?

**If scores are low**, iterate before launching. Testing costs $900 and 3 days. NOT testing costs months of confused prospects.

**→ For comprehensive testing guide**: See [Positioning Testing & Validation](/references/core/06-positioning-testing-validation.md)

**Output**: Validated positioning ready for internal rollout and market launch

## Timeline: How Long Does This Take?

**Typical timeline for positioning work (2024 updated):**

| Activity | Duration | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Pre-work (identify best customers, assemble team) | 2-3 days | Can be done async |
| Positioning workshop (Steps 1-10) | 1 week | 3-5 sessions, 2-3 hours each |
| Documentation and refinement | 2-3 days | Clean up workshop output |
| **Testing (NEW - critical)** | **3-5 days** | **Wynter: 12-48 hours + analysis** |
| Iteration if needed | 3-5 days | If test scores low, refine and retest |
| **Total** | **2-4 weeks** | Include testing, can't skip |

**Workshop schedule options:**

**Option A: Intensive (3 days)**
- Day 1: Steps 1-4 (competitive alternatives through best-fit customers)
- Day 2: Steps 5-7 (market category and competitive analysis)
- Day 3: Steps 8-10 (positioning statement and documentation)

**Option B: Distributed (5 sessions over 2 weeks)**
- Session 1: Steps 1-3
- Session 2: Steps 4-5
- Session 3: Steps 6-7
- Session 4: Steps 8-9
- Session 5: Step 10 + review

**Don't skip time for:**
- Thoughtful debate on unique attributes (Step 2)
- Testing different market categories (Step 5)
- Proper documentation (Step 10)

## Common Positioning Mistakes

### 1. Positioning Baggage

**Problem**: Can't see product objectively due to history.

Teams think "we've always been X" or "we built this to be Y" even when market sees it differently.

**Solution**: "Positioning baggage exercise" - pretend you're positioning a competitor's product. What would you say? Often reveals clearer positioning.

### 2. Misalignment Not Positioning

**Problem**: Product has clear positioning, but teams don't agree or understand it.

Symptoms:
- Sales explains value differently than marketing
- Product team emphasizes different features
- Customer success sells different vision

**Solution**: This is a rollout/enablement problem, not a positioning problem. See `05-internal-rollout-guide.md`.

### 3. Too Broad Positioning

**Problem**: Trying to be everything to everyone.

Results in generic messaging that resonates with nobody.

**Solution**: Start narrow with best-fit customers. You can expand later once you own a specific niche.

### 4. Feature-List Positioning

**Problem**: Positioning focuses on what you do, not value delivered.

"We're a platform with features A, B, and C" tells me nothing about why I should care.

**Solution**: Always connect capabilities to value. "Because we have X, you get Y."

### 5. Me-Too Positioning

**Problem**: Positioning makes you sound like everyone else in the category.

If you removed your name and put in a competitor's, would anyone notice?

**Solution**: Focus on what's genuinely unique and valuable. If there's nothing unique, you have a product problem, not a positioning problem.

### 6. Skipping Customer Research

**Problem**: Positioning created in conference room without customer input.

Results in messaging that doesn't match how customers think or talk.

**Solution**: Base positioning on patterns from your best customers. Use their language, their pain points, their desired outcomes.

## Positioning for Different Company Stages

### Early Stage (Pre-PMF)

**Don't nail down positioning yet.**

- Keep it flexible as you learn
- Test different customer segments
- Be open to pivoting completely
- Focus on finding customers who love what you have

**Keep positioning loose** - think fishing net, not spear.

### Growth Stage (Post-PMF, Scaling)

**This is ideal time for rigorous positioning work.**

- You have enough customers to see patterns
- Market is starting to categorize you
- Competition is emerging
- Need to scale go-to-market efficiently

**Invest heavily in getting positioning right** - it's your foundation for scaling.

### Mature Stage (Established Product)

**Revisit positioning when market shifts.**

Triggers:
- New competitive threats
- Market category evolving
- Your capabilities have changed significantly
- Customer needs have shifted
- You're entering new markets

**Don't fix what's not broken** - but don't ignore market changes either.

## Using This Positioning

Once you have solid positioning:

1. **Messaging** - Translate positioning into customer-facing messages (see `02-pain-claim-gain-messaging.md`)

2. **Go-to-market strategy** - Let positioning guide:
   - Which markets to target
   - What messages to emphasize
   - How to compete
   - Where to invest

3. **Product roadmap** - Build features that strengthen your positioning

4. **Sales enablement** - Train teams on how to position (see `09-sales-enablement-integration.md`)

5. **Marketing campaigns** - All campaigns should ladder up to positioning

Positioning is your strategic foundation. Everything else builds from here.
