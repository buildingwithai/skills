# Glossary: Positioning Terms

Quick reference for positioning-specific terminology.

## Core Positioning Concepts

**Positioning**
- Definition: Context-setting for your product that makes your value obvious to your best-fit customers
- Not marketing, not messaging - it's the foundation that informs both
- Answers: Who is this for? What alternatives exist? Why are we different?

**Best-Fit Customers**
- The specific segment that gets the MOST value from your product
- Not "everyone" - focusing is key
- Also called: ICP (Ideal Customer Profile), target customer

**Competitive Alternatives**
- What customers would do if your product didn't exist
- Three types: Status quo, internal build, direct competitors
- NOT just "competitors" - broader than that

**Unique Capabilities (Differentiated Features)**
- Features/capabilities you have that alternatives don't
- Must be provable and defensible
- Focus on "only we can" not "we do better"

**Value (Differentiated Value)**
- The outcome/benefit customers get from your unique capabilities
- Must tie directly to unique capabilities
- Expressed in customer language, not feature speak

**Market Category**
- The market context that makes your value obvious
- Examples: CRM, Marketing Automation, Dev Tools
- Can be: Existing category, subcategory, or new category

## Competitive Positioning Types

**Market Leader**
- Dominant player in category
- Sets standards, owns category
- Positioning: Category ownership, thought leadership

**Challenger**
- Alternative to market leader
- Positioning: "Better than leader at [X]"
- Must focus on specific differentiator

**Nicher**
- Best for specific segment
- Positioning: "Only solution built for [specific audience]"
- Wins by focus, not breadth

## Category Types

**Existing Category**
- Customers already understand it
- Examples: CRM, Email Marketing, Project Management
- Challenge: Differentiation

**Subcategory**
- Subset of existing category
- Example: "Sales Engagement Platform" within CRM
- Balance: Familiar but different

**New Category**
- Creating entirely new market
- Requires significant customer education
- High risk, high reward

## Related Terms

## Common Positioning Mistakes

**Too Broad**
- Positioning for "everyone"
- No clear best-fit customer
- Fix: Narrow to specific segment

**Feature-Focused**

- "What it does" instead of "why it matters"
- Fix: Map features to customer outcomes

**Wrong Category**

- Customers confused about what you do
- Fix: Test different category framing

**No Alternatives**
