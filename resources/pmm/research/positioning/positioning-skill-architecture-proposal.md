# Positioning Skill: Architecture Proposal

**Date**: November 8, 2025
**Based on**: Comprehensive 2024-2025 positioning research

---

## Executive Summary

After deep research on current positioning methodologies, I'm proposing to expand the positioning skill from **3 files to 12 files** (6 core, 6 advanced), focusing on April Dunford's proven methodology while incorporating modern approaches.

**Key Additions**:
- Competitive alternatives analysis (core to positioning)
- ICP-driven positioning (data-driven approach)
- Testing & validation methods (Wynter + internal)
- Category design & strategic narrative (advanced alternatives)
- Repositioning guidance (missing from current research)
- Proof points & metrics (quantifying differentiation)

---

## Self-Critique: Essential vs Bloat

### ✅ MUST INCLUDE (High Value, Frequently Used)

**1. April Dunford's 10-Step Framework** ✓ *We have this*
- Most proven methodology (200+ companies)
- Systematic, repeatable
- Works for 90% of B2B SaaS

 companies
- **Action**: Keep and enhance with 2024 examples

**2. Competitive Alternatives Analysis** ❌ *Missing*
- Core to Dunford framework
- Most misunderstood part of positioning
- Grounds positioning in reality
- **Action**: CREATE new core file

**3. ICP-Driven Positioning** ❌ *Missing*
- Data-driven, measurable
- 2024 best practice (Gartner framework)
- Ties positioning to actual customers
- **Action**: CREATE new core file

**4. Testing & Validation** ❌ *Missing*
- Wynter platform (proven 2024 case studies)
- Internal/no-code alternatives
- Continuous validation mindset
- **Action**: CREATE new core file

**5. Positioning Statements & Templates** ⚠️ *Have template, need guide*
- Multiple formats for different contexts
- Immediately practical
- **Action**: CREATE new core file + expand templates

**6. Differentiated Value & Proof Points** ❌ *Missing*
- How to quantify differentiation
- Types of proof (metrics, customers, features)
- Building credibility
- **Action**: CREATE new core file

---

### ⚠️ VALUABLE (Include as Advanced)

**7. Category Design (Lochhead)**
- Powerful for innovation/new markets
- Not for everyone (requires investment)
- 2024 book, very current
- **Action**: CREATE as advanced file

**8. Strategic Narrative (Raskin)**
- Compelling story-based approach
- Less systematic than Dunford
- Works well for complex sales
- **Action**: CREATE as advanced file

**9. Repositioning Existing Products**
- Gap in current research
- Different from initial positioning
- Common need (see Databook case study)
- **Action**: CREATE as advanced file

**10. Portfolio Positioning**
- Multi-product positioning challenges
- Product vs company positioning
- Gap in research
- **Action**: CREATE as advanced file

**11. Crowded Market Differentiation**
- Specific strategies for saturated markets
- Vertical vs horizontal differentiation
- 2024 focus area
- **Action**: CREATE as advanced file

**12. Positioning Metrics & Measurement**
- How to know if positioning is working
- Gap in research (lots on testing, little on ongoing measurement)
- **Action**: CREATE as advanced file

---

### ❌ SKIP or MINIMIZE (Bloat)

**Classic Frameworks (Ries & Trout, Moore)**
- Historically important but dated
- Not actively used in 2024
- **Action**: Brief mention in glossary only

**Generic Business Strategy** (Porter, SWOT, BCG)
- Standard MBA content
- Users can find elsewhere
- **Action**: Brief mention, not full guides

**Homepage-Only Positioning (Pierri)**
- Narrow focus (just web application)
- Better suited for messaging-rollout skill
- **Action**: Reference but don't include full guide

**JTBD as Primary Methodology (Moesta)**
- Valuable for research
- Too time-intensive as primary approach
- **Action**: Include as research method in ICP file, not standalone

# Product Positioning

Position your product so customers instantly understand its value and why it's different.

**✨ COMPREHENSIVE**: Deeply researched guides on positioning testing (Wynter platform), category design, strategic narrative, and repositioning strategies with 2024 case studies.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Create positioning** for new B2B SaaS products
- **Reposition** existing products in new market categories
- **Test and validate** positioning before launch (Wynter, internal methods)
- **Differentiate** in crowded/saturated markets
- **Analyze competitive alternatives** and identify your unique value
- **Develop positioning statements** with proof points and metrics

**NOT for:**
- Messaging (use `messaging` skill - positioning must come first)
- Rollout and launch (use `positioning-rollout` skill after positioning is complete)

## Prerequisites

### None - Start Here

Positioning is the foundation of all PMM work. You should create positioning BEFORE messaging.

**What you need to start:**
- Product knowledge (what it does, how it works)
- Customer insights (who uses it, what problems they have)
- Competitive landscape awareness (alternatives that exist)

**If you have these, you're ready to position.**

## The Positioning Process

Timeline: 2-4 weeks from research to validated positioning

```
CUSTOMER RESEARCH → COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS → POSITIONING DEVELOPMENT → TESTING → VALIDATION
(Week 1)            (Week 1-2)              (Week 2-3)                (Week 3-4) (Week 4)
```

## Quick Decision Trees

**Creating positioning from scratch:**
→ Read: core/01-positioning-foundation → 02-competitive-alternatives → 03-icp-driven
→ Use: assets/templates/positioning-canvas-template.md
→ Timeline: 2-3 weeks

**Testing positioning before launch:**
→ Read: core/06-positioning-testing-validation
→ Use: Wynter ($899/test) or internal methods
→ Timeline: 1-2 weeks

**Repositioning existing product:**
→ Read: advanced/repositioning-existing-products
→ Also see: core/06-testing (validate new positioning)
→ Timeline: 3-4 weeks

**Differentiating in crowded market:**
→ Read: advanced/crowded-market-differentiation
→ Also see: core/02-competitive-alternatives (find real differentiation)

**Creating new category:**
→ Read: advanced/category-design-positioning
→ Use: Dirty Dozen framework (12 early customers)
→ Timeline: 3-6 months

## Key Principles

### 1. Positioning ≠ Messaging

**Positioning** (internal strategy):
- Who we compete against
- What makes us different
- Why customers choose us

**Messaging** (external communication):
- How we talk about positioning
- Words we use
- Benefits we emphasize

Positioning must come first. Messaging without positioning is guessing.

### 2. Grounded in Reality, Not Aspirations

Position based on:
- ✅ What customers actually compare you to (competitive alternatives)
- ✅ Who gets value TODAY (best-fit customers)
- ✅ What you can prove (differentiated value with proof points)

Not based on:
- ❌ Who you want to compete with
- ❌ Who you want as customers
- ❌ What you plan to build

### 3. Testing is Not Optional (2024 Best Practice)

Don't launch untested positioning:
- External testing: Wynter (B2B verified audiences)
- Internal testing: Customer interviews, landing pages
- Continuous validation: Positioning isn't static

Companies that test positioning see dramatic improvements:
- Databook: 67% conversion increase, 10x lead growth
- Cognism: 43% demo conversion increase
- Appcues: 73% signup conversion improvement

### 4. Start Narrow, Then Expand (Beachhead Strategy)

Win a narrow segment first (3-18 months):
- Easier to differentiate
- Faster to dominate
- Clearer messaging
- Better word-of-mouth

Then expand to adjacent segments.

## Related Skills

**Prerequisites (complete first):**
- None - positioning is the foundation

**Next steps after positioning:**
- **`messaging`** - Create messaging based on positioning
- **`positioning-rollout`** - Roll out positioning internally and test externally

**Complementary skills:**
- **`competitive-intelligence`** - Deep competitive analysis
- **`customer-research`** - Customer insights for positioning

## Outputs from This Skill

When you complete positioning, you'll have:

✅ **Competitive alternatives map** - What you compete against (and why)
✅ **Differentiated value** - What makes you different with proof points
✅ **Best-fit customer profile** - Who gets the most value
✅ **Market category** - Where you compete
✅ **Positioning statement** - Clear articulation of your position
✅ **Tested & validated** - Data showing positioning resonates

**Next:** Use `messaging` skill to translate positioning into communication.

## Typical Timeline

| Activity | Duration | Can Compress? |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Customer research | 3-5 days | ⚠️ Not below 2 days |
| Competitive analysis | 2-3 days | ✓ Yes, to 1 day if data ready |
| ICP analysis | 3-5 days | ✓ Yes, if CRM data clean |
| Positioning development | 3-5 days | ⚠️ Not below 2 days |
| Testing (external - Wynter) | 1-2 weeks | ✓ Yes, to 3-5 days (faster results) |
| Testing (internal) | 3-5 days | ✓ Yes, to 1-2 days |
| **Total** | **2-4 weeks** | **Can compress to 2 weeks (risky)** |

**Note:** Rollout adds 2-4 weeks - see `positioning-rollout` skill.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Skipping competitive alternatives** → Positioning disconnected from reality
2. **Positioning for everyone** → Weak, generic differentiation
3. **No proof points** → Claims not credible
4. **Wrong category** → Value not obvious to prospects
5. **No testing** → Launching with untested positioning = expensive mistakes
6. **One-time exercise** → Positioning needs continuous refinement

## Getting Started

**New to positioning?**
1. Read core/01-positioning-foundation (April Dunford framework)
2. Complete core/02-competitive-alternatives (understand what you compete with)
3. Work through core/03-icp-driven (who you're positioning for)
4. Develop positioning statement (core/05)
5. Test with target customers (core/06)

**Have experience?**
1. Scan core/01 for refresher
2. Jump to specific need (repositioning, category design, testing)
3. Use templates and get to work

**Ready to communicate positioning?**
→ Move to `messaging` skill to translate positioning into messages

## Key Principles for File Development

1. **Actionable, Not Academic** - Every file must have templates, frameworks, examples
2. **2024-2025 Current** - Use recent case studies, avoid dated references
3. **Proof with Metrics** - Real results (Databook 10x leads, Cognism 43% increase)
4. **Clear Length Targets** - Core 400-500 lines, Advanced 350-400 lines
5. **Progressive Disclosure** - Files reference each other, Claude loads as needed
6. **Positioning ≠ Messaging** - Reinforce distinction throughout

## Final Recommendation

**Expand positioning skill from 3 files → 12 files (6 core + 6 advanced)**

This depth is justified because:
- Positioning is foundation of all PMM work
- Current skill has 1 core file (positioning-foundation) - insufficient depth
- Research uncovered critical gaps (testing, ICP, competitive analysis, repositioning)
- 2024 best practices require testing/validation - we have nothing on this
- Multiple proven frameworks now exist (Dunford, Lochhead, Raskin) worth including

**Comparable to messaging skill**: Messaging has 8 files, positioning deserves 12 given its foundational importance.

**Next step**: Begin building Phase 1 files (competitive alternatives, ICP-driven, testing/validation).
