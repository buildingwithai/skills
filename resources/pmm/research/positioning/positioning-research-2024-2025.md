## 1. Core Positioning Frameworks (2024-2025)

### 1.1 April Dunford - Obviously Awesome (Still Dominant)

**Status**: Current, actively used
**Last Updated**: Ongoing (2024 podcast appearances, workshops)
**Sources**:
- Her official website and methodology guides (2024)
- Userlist case study applying 10-step method (2024)
- Lenny's Newsletter interview (2024)

**The 10-Step Positioning Process**:

The methodology addresses **5+1 key components**:
1. **Competitive Alternatives** - What would customers do if your solution didn't exist?
2. **Differentiated Features** - What do we have that alternatives don't?
3. **Differentiated Value** - What value do those features deliver?
4. **Best-Fit Customers** - Who gets the most value from these differentiators?
5. **Market Category** - What context makes our value obvious?
6. **(+1) Positioning Statement** - Synthesizing the above into communication

**Why It's Still #1**:
- Hands-on work with 200+ companies (Google, IBM, Postman, Epic Games)
- Systematic, repeatable process
- Works particularly well for B2B tech/SaaS
- Based on competitive alternatives (reality) not aspirations

**Application Example** (2024):
- Userlist repositioned from "email automation" to "customer messaging"
- Result: "magic effect on customer understanding"

**Strength**: Systematic, proven with hundreds of companies
**Weakness**: Can feel mechanical, less emphasis on narrative/story

### 1.2 Christopher Lochhead - Category Design

**Status**: Very current, 2024 book release
**Last Updated**: December 2024
**Sources**:
- "The Category Design Toolkit" (2024 book)
- Podcast episodes July-December 2024
- Harvard Business Publishing analysis (2024)

**Core Concept**:
Don't compete in existing categories - **create your own category** and position yourself as the leader

**Key Principle**:
"The category makes the brand" - Your positioning is defined by the category you create/own

**Framework Evolution**:
Category design has evolved from a "positioning secret" to "the most in-demand skill among business leaders" (2024)

**When to Use**:
- Creating genuinely new solutions
- Mature, saturated markets where differentiation is hard
- When you have strong POV on how the world is changing

**Real Example**:
- Strategic Relationship Management (SRM) as new category
- Companies positioning in AI/sustainability categories (2024 Harvard analysis)

**The Dirty Dozen Framework** (November 2024):
- Work with first 12 customers to validate category
- Look for 6-8 who share same core problem and solution satisfaction
- Use to validate if category is real

**Strength**: Powerful for true innovation, creates "blue ocean"
**Weakness**: Hard to execute, requires substantial market education investment

---

### 1.3 Andy Raskin - Strategic Narrative

**Status**: Current, active consulting 2024
**Last Updated**: 2024 (Lenny's Newsletter, Notion podcast)
**Sources**:
- Multiple 2024 podcast appearances
- LinkedIn posts throughout 2024
- Clients: Gong, Dropbox, Uber, Salesforce, Square, IBM

**Core Concept**:
Positioning should be a **story about how the world has changed**, not bragging about your solution

**The Framework**:
1. **The "Promised Land"** - What will customers see/feel/experience?
2. **Old vs New Game** - How has the world changed?
3. **Humble Awakener vs Bragging Doctor** - Empathy over features
4. **Sales Deck as Narrative Core** - Guide decisions when CEO not in room

**Key Insight**:
"Strategy narrative is a story in a person's head that guides their actions and decisions"

**Differentiation**:
Based on prospects seeing you **make sense of their world** (empathy) rather than product superiority

**2016 Article Still Influential**:
"The Greatest Sales Deck I've Ever Seen" - remains referenced in 2024

**Strength**: Powerful for complex sales, builds emotional connection
**Weakness**: Requires strong narrative skills, less tactical/systematic

"The struggling moment is the seed for all innovation" - position around the job customers are hiring your product to do

**Framework**:
- Understand struggling moments causing customers to seek solutions
- Focus on **underlying jobs**, not features
- Use interviews to get positioning right

**Product vs Organizational Positioning**:
Moesta focuses on **product-level positioning** rather than organizational-level

**Integration with Teams**:
Get product, sales, and other teams involved in JTBD interviews to create **common language** across functions

**Demand-Side Sales Framework**:
JTBD insights feed into his Demand-Side Sales approach (2020 book, still current)

**Strength**: Deep customer understanding, reveals true motivation
**Weakness**: Requires extensive customer research, time-intensive

### 3.2 Positioning vs Messaging Rollout

**Status**: Current distinction (2024)
**Sources**: Multiple 2024 articles on positioning vs messaging

**Key Distinction**:

**Positioning Rollout** = **Strategic Alignment**
- Getting exec buy-in on target market
- Aligning on competitive alternatives
- Agreeing on differentiation
- Strategic decision-making
- **Audience**: Execs, product, PMM (smaller group)

**Messaging Rollout** = **Tactical Training**
- Training sales/CS on how to talk
- Creating materials and templates
- Practicing messaging in role-plays
- Enablement and enforcement
- **Audience**: Broader org (sales, CS, marketing)

**Critical Insight**:
"Positioning defines who you compete against, what makes you different, and why customers choose you. Messaging is how you communicate that in different contexts."

**Positioning Must Come First**:
"Without well-defined position, even most polished messaging will lack direction and fall flat"

### 5.2 Product-Led Growth Impact

**Trend** (2024):
Companies with self-serve revenue outperform across virtually every metric

**Positioning Implication**:
Homepage/product positioning more critical - users self-educate before talking to sales

---

### 5.3 AI as Table Stakes (Not Differentiator)

**Critical 2024 Insight**:
"AI capabilities are no longer a differentiator - AI has become table stakes that buyers are increasingly skeptical of"

**Positioning Advice**:
Don't lead with "AI-powered" - focus on outcomes and workflows

---

### 5.4 Crowded Market Differentiation

**Status**: Major focus area (2024)
**Sources**: Multiple 2024 articles on differentiation strategies

**Two Paths to Differentiation**:
1. Create real product/business model differentiation
2. Move to underserved market segment
